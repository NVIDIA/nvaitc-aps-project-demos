Freeman's approach to meditation helped shape Lee's understanding of the practice, establishing a deeper connection to spiritual reflection.\n\nBoth of these mentors contributed to Lee Kuan Yew's journey into meditation, allowing him to cultivate a sense of serenity and introspection amidst the complexities he faced in public life.",

Why I\nthought of Kim was because I have just been through a list of audio books to\nchoose for my wife. Jane Austen, Emily Bronte, books she has on her book shelf.\nSo, I ticked off the ones I think she would find interesting. The one that caught\nmy eye was Kim. She was into literature, from Alice in Wonderland, to\nAdventures with a Looking Glass, to Jane Austen‟s Persuasion, Pride and\nPrejudice, and Sense and Sensibility. Jane Austen was her favourite writer\nbecause she wrote elegant and leisurely English prose of the 19th century. The\nprose flowed beautifully, described the human condition in a graceful way, and\nrolls off the tongue and in the mind. She enjoyed it. Also Chaucer‟s Canterbury\nTales. She was an English Literature major.”\nQ: “You are naming books on the list, not necessarily books you have already\nread, yes?”\nMr Lee: “I would have read some of them.”\n\nThe 'he' is likely referring to Mr. Lee himself.\n\nHowever, in another section of the transcript:\nQ: “Tell me about meditation?”\nMr Lee: “Well, I started it about two, three years ago when Ng Kok Song, the\nChief Investment Officer of the Government of Singapore Investment\nCorporation, I knew he was doing meditation. His wife had died but he was\ncompletely serene. So, I said, how do you achieve this? He said I meditate\neveryday and so did my wife and when she was dying of cancer, she was totally\nserene because she meditated everyday and he gave me a video of her in her\nlast few weeks completely composed completely relaxed and she and him had\nbeen meditating for years. Well, I said to him, you teach me. He is a devout\nChristian. He was taught by a man called Laurence Freeman, a Catholic. His\nguru was John Main a devout Catholic.\n\nIn this case, the 'he' is likely referring to Ng Kok Song, who was teaching Mr. Lee about meditation.",
