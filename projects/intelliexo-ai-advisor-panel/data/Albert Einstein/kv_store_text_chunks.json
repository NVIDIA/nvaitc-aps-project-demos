The discussion between the two great\nmen was recorded, and was subsequently published in the\nJanuary, 1931 issue of Modern Review.\nTAGORE: You have been busy, hunting down with mathemat-\nics, the two ancient entities, time and space, while I have been\nlecturing in this country on the eternal world of man, the uni-\nverse of reality.\nEINSTEIN: Do you believe in the divine isolated from the world?\nTAGORE: Not isolated. The infinite personality of man com-\nprehends the universe. There cannot be anything that cannot\nbe subsumed by the human personality, and this proves that the\ntruth of the universe is human truth.\nEINSTEIN: There are two different conceptions about the na-\nture of the universe — the world as a unity dependent on human-\nity, and the world as reality independent of the human factor.\nTAGORE: When our universe is in harmony with man, the eter-\nnal, we know it as truth, we feel it as beauty.\nEINSTEIN: This is a purely human conception of the universe.\nTAGORE: The world is a human world — the scientific view\nof it is also that of the scientific man. Therefore, the world\n1\napart from us does not exist; it is a relative world, depending\nfor its reality upon our consciousness. There is some standard\nof reason and enjoyment which gives it truth, the standard of\nthe eternal man whose experiences are made possible through\nour experiences.\nEINSTEIN: This is a realization of the human entity.\nTAGORE: Yes, one eternal entity. We have to realize it through\nour emotions and activities. We realize the supreme man, who\nhas no individual limitations, through our limitations.\nScience is concerned with that which is not confined to individu-\nals; it is the impersonal human world of truths. Religion realizes\nthese truths and links them up with our deeper needs. Our indi-\nvidual consciousness of truth gains universal significance. Reli-\ngion applies values to truth, and we know truth as good through\nown harmony with it.\nEINSTEIN: Truth, then, or beauty, is not independent of man?\nTAGORE: No, I do not say so.\nEINSTEIN: If there were no human beings any more, the Apollo\nBelvedere no longer would be beautiful?\nTAGORE: No!\nEINSTEIN: I agree with this conception of beauty, but not with\nregard to truth.\nTAGORE: Why not? Truth is realized through men.\nEINSTEIN: I cannot prove my conception is right, but that is\nmy religion.\nTAGORE: Beauty is in the ideal of perfect harmony, which is\nin the universal being; truth is the perfect comprehension of\nthe universal mind.

    "content": "1\nTHE WORLD AS I SEE IT\nAlbert Einstein\n PREFACE TO ORIGINAL EDITION\n Only individuals have a sense of responsibility. --Nietzsche\nThis book does not represent a complete collection of the articles, addresses,\nand pronouncements of Albert Einstein; it is a selection made with a definite\nobject-- namely, to give a picture of a man. To-day this man is being drawn,\ncontrary to his own intention, into the whirlpool of political passions and\ncontemporary history. As a result, Einstein is experiencing the fate that so\nmany of the great men of history experienced: his character and opinions are\nbeing exhibited to the world in an utterly distorted form.\nTo forestall this fate is the real object of this book. It meets a wish that has\nconstantly been expressed both by Einstein's friends and by the wider public.\nIt contains work belonging to the most various dates-- the article on \"The\nInternational of Science\" dates from the year 1922, the address on \"The\nPrinciples of Scientific Research\" from 1923, the \"Letter to an Arab\" from\n1930--and the most various spheres, held together by the unity of the\npersonality which stands behind all these utterances. Albert Einstein believes\nin humanity, in a peaceful world of mutual helpfulness, and in the high mission\nof science. This book is intended as a plea for this belief at a time which\ncompels every one of us to overhaul his mental attitude and his ideas.\nJ. H.\n2\nINTRODUCTION TO ABRIDGED\n EDITION\nIn his biography of Einstein Mr. H. Gordou Garbedian relates that an\nAmerican newspaper man asked the great physicist for a definition of his\ntheory of relativity in one sentence. Einstein replied that it would take him\nthree days to give a short definition of relativity. He might well have added\nthat unless his questioner had an intimate acquaintance with mathematics and\nphysics, the definition would be incomprehensible.\nTo the majority of people Einstein's theory is a complete mystery. Their\nattitude towards Einstein is like that of Mark Twain towards the writer of a\nwork on mathematics: here was a man who had written an entire book of\nwhich Mark could not understand a single sentence. Einstein, therefore, is\ngreat in the public eye partly because he has made revolutionary discoveries\nwhich cannot be translated into the common tongue. We stand in proper awe\nof a man whose thoughts move on heights far beyond our range, whose\nachievements can be measured only by the few who are able to follow his\nreasoning and challenge his conclusions.\nThere is, however, another side to his personality. It is revealed in the\naddresses, letters, and occasional writings brought together in this book.\nThese fragments form a mosaic portrait of Einstein the man. Each one is, in a\nsense, complete in itself; it presents his views on some aspect of progress,\neducation, peace, war, liberty, or other problems of universal interest. Their\ncombined effect is to demonstrate that the Einstein we can all understand is no\nless great than the Einstein we take on trust.\nEinstein has asked nothing more from life than the freedom to pursue his\nresearches into the mechanism of the universe. His nature is of rare simplicity\nand sincerity; he always has been, and he remains, genuinely indifferent to\nwealth and fame and the other prizes so dear to ambition. At the same time he\nis no recluse, shutting himself off from the sorrows and agitations of the world\naround him. Himself familiar from early years with the handicap of poverty\nand with some of the worst forms of man's inhumanity to man, he has never\nspared himself in defence of the weak and the oppressed. Nothing could be\nmore unwelcome to his sensitive and retiring character than the glare of the\nplatform and the heat of public controversy, yet he has never hesitated when\nhe felt that his voice or influence would help to redress a wrong. History,\nsurely, has few parallels with this introspective mathematical genius who\nlaboured unceasingly as an eager champion of the rights of man.\n3\nAlbert Einstein was born in 1879 at Ulm. When he was four years old his\nfather, who owned an electrochemical works, moved to Munich, and two\nyears later the boy went to school, experiencing a rigid, almost military, type\nof discipline and also the isolation of a shy and contemplative Jewish child\namong Roman Catholics-- factors which made a deep and enduring\nimpression. From the point of view of his teachers he was an unsatisfactory\npupil, apparently incapable of progress in languages, history, geography, and\nother primary subjects. His interest in mathematics was roused, not by his\ninstructors, but by a Jewish medical student, Max Talmey, who gave him a\nbook on geometry, and so set him upon a course of enthusiastic study which\nmade him, at the age of fourteen, a better mathematician than his masters. At\nthis stage also he began the study of philosophy, reading and re-reading the\nwords of Kant and other metaphysicians.\nBusiness reverses led the elder Einstein to make a fresh start in Milan, thus\nintroducing Albert to the joys of a freer, sunnier life than had been possible in\nGermany. Necessity, however, made this holiday a brief one, and after a few\nmonths of freedom the preparation for a career began. It opened with an\neffort, backed by a certificate of mathematical proficiency given by a teacher\nin the Gymnasium at Munich, to obtain admission to the Polytechnic Academy\nat Zurich. A year passed in the study of necessary subjects which he had\nneglected for mathematics, but once admitted, the young Einstein became",

It opened with an\neffort, backed by a certificate of mathematical proficiency given by a teacher\nin the Gymnasium at Munich, to obtain admission to the Polytechnic Academy\nat Zurich. A year passed in the study of necessary subjects which he had\nneglected for mathematics, but once admitted, the young Einstein became\nabsorbed in the pursuit of science and philosophy and made astonishing\nprogress. After five distinguished years at the Polytechnic he hoped to step\ninto the post of assistant professor, but found that the kindly words of the\nprofessors who had stimulated the hope did not materialize.\nThen followed a weary search for work, two brief interludes of teaching, and\na stable appointment as examiner at the Confederate Patent Office at Berrie.\nHumdrum as the work was, it had the double advantage of providing a\ncompetence and of leaving his mind free for the mathematical speculations\nwhich were then taking shape in the theory of relativity. In 1905 his first\nmonograph on the theory was published in a Swiss scientific journal, the\nAnnalen der Physik. Zurich awoke to the fact that it possessed a genius in\nthe form of a patent office clerk, promoted him to be a lecturer at the\nUniversity and four years later--in 1909--installed him as Professor.\nHis next appointment was (in 1911) at the University of Prague, where he\nremained for eighteen months. Following a brief return to Zurich, he went,\nearly in 1914, to Berlin as a professor in the Prussian Academy of Sciences\nand director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Theoretical Physics. The\nperiod of the Great War was a trying time for Einstein, who could not conceal\nhis ardent pacifism, but he found what solace he could in his studies. Later\n4\nevents brought him into the open and into many parts of the world, as an\nexponent not only of pacifism but also of world-disarmament and the cause of\nJewry. To a man of such views, as passionately held as they were by Einstein,\nGermany under the Nazis was patently impossible. In 1933 Einstein made his\nfamous declaration: \"As long as I have any choice, I will stay only in a country\nwhere political liberty, toleration, and equality of all citizens before the law are\nthe rule.\" For a time he was a homeless exile; after offers had come to him\nfrom Spain and France and Britain, he settled in Princeton as Professor of\nMathematical and Theoretical Physics, happy in his work, rejoicing in a free\nenvironment, but haunted always by the tragedy of war and oppression.\nThe World As I See It, in its original form, includes essays by Einstein on\nrelativity and cognate subjects. For reasons indicated above, these have been\nomitted in the present edition; the object of this reprint is simply to reveal to\nthe general reader the human side of one of the most dominating figures of our\nday.\n5\nI\n The World As I See It\nThe Meaning of Life\nWhat is the meaning of human life, or of organic life altogether? To answer\nthis question at all implies a religion. Is there any sense then, you ask, in\nputting it? I answer, the man who regards his own life and that of his\nfellow-creatures as meaningless is not merely unfortunate but almost\ndisqualified for life.\nThe World as I see it\nWhat an extraordinary situation is that of us mortals! Each of us is here for a\nbrief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he\nfeels it. But from the point of view of daily life, without going deeper, we exist\nfor our fellow-men--in the first place for those on whose smiles and welfare all\nour happiness depends, and next for all those unknown to us personally with\nwhose destinies we are bound up by the tie of sympathy. A hundred times\nevery day I remind myself that my inner and outer life depend on the labours\nof other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in\nthe same measure as I have received and am still receiving. I am strongly\ndrawn to the simple life and am often oppressed by the feeling that I am\nengrossing an unnecessary amount of the labour of my fellow-men. I regard\nclass differences as contrary to justice and, in the last resort, based on force. I\nalso consider that plain living is good for everybody, physically and mentally.\nIn human freedom in the philosophical sense I am definitely a disbeliever.\nEverybody acts not only under external compulsion but also in accordance\nwith inner necessity. Schopenhauer's saying, that \"a man can do as he will, but\nnot will as he will,\" has been an inspiration to me since my youth up, and a\ncontinual consolation and unfailing well-spring of patience in the face of the\nhardships of life, my own and others'. This feeling mercifully mitigates the\nsense of responsibility which so easily becomes paralysing, and it prevents us\nfrom taking ourselves and other people too seriously; it conduces to a view of\nlife in which humour, above all, has its due place.\nTo inquire after the meaning or object of one's own existence or of creation\ngenerally has always seemed to me absurd from an objective point of view.\n6\nAnd yet everybody has certain ideals which determine the direction of his\nendeavours and his judgments.

In this sense I have never looked upon ease\nand happiness as ends in themselves--such an ethical basis I call more proper\nfor a herd of swine. The ideals which have lighted me on my way and time\nafter time given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Truth,\nGoodness, and Beauty. Without the sense of fellowship with men of like mind,\nof preoccupation with the objective, the eternally unattainable in the field of art\nand scientific research, life would have seemed to me empty. The ordinary\nobjects of human endeavour--property, outward success, luxury--have\nalways seemed to me contemptible.\nMy passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always\ncontrasted oddly with my pronounced freedom from the need for direct\ncontact with other human beings and human communities. I gang my own gait\nand have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my\nimmediate family, with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties I have never\nlost an obstinate sense of detachment, of the need for solitude--a feeling\nwhich increases with the years. One is sharply conscious, yet without regret,\nof the limits to the possibility of mutual understanding and sympathy with one's\nfellow-creatures. Such a person no doubt loses something in the way of\ngeniality and light-heartedness ; on the other hand, he is largely independent of\nthe opinions, habits, and judgments of his fellows and avoids the temptation to\ntake his stand on such insecure foundations.\nMy political ideal is that of democracy. Let every man be respected as an\nindividual and no man idolized. It is an irony of fate that I myself have been the\nrecipient of excessive admiration and respect from my fellows through no\nfault, and no merit, of my own. The cause of this may well be the desire,\nunattainable for many, to understand the one or two ideas to which I have\nwith my feeble powers attained through ceaseless struggle. I am quite aware\nthat it is necessary for the success of any complex undertaking that one man\nshould do the thinking and directing and in general bear the responsibility. But\nthe led must not be compelled, they must be able to choose their leader. An\nautocratic system of coercion, in my opinion, soon degenerates. For force\nalways attracts men of low morality, and I believe it to be an invariable rule\nthat tyrants of genius are succeeded by scoundrels. For this reason I have\nalways been passionately opposed to systems such as we see in Italy and\nRussia to-day. The thing that has brought discredit upon the prevailing form of\ndemocracy in Europe to-day is not to be laid to the door of the democratic\nidea as such, but to lack of stability on the part of the heads of governments\nand to the impersonal character of the electoral system. I believe that in this\nrespect the United States of America have found the right way. They have a\nresponsible President who is elected for a sufficiently long period and has\n7\nsufficient powers to be really responsible. On the other hand, what I value in\nour political system is the more extensive provision that it makes for the\nindividual in case of illness or need. The really valuable thing in the pageant of\nhuman life seems to me not the State but the creative, sentient individual, the\npersonality; it alone creates the noble and the sublime, while the herd as such\nremains dull in thought and dull in feeling.\nThis topic brings me to that worst outcrop of the herd nature, the military\nsystem, which I abhor. That a man can take pleasure in marching in formation\nto the strains of a band is enough to make me despise him. He has only been\ngiven his big brain by mistake; a backbone was all he needed. This\nplague-spot of civilization ought to be abolished with all possible speed.\nHeroism by order, senseless violence, and all the pestilent nonsense that does\nby the name of patriotism--how I hate them! War seems to me a mean,\ncontemptible thing: I would rather be hacked in pieces than take part in such\nan abominable business. And yet so high, in spite of everything, is my opinion\nof the human race that I believe this bogey would have disappeared long ago,\nhad the sound sense of the nations not been systematically corrupted by\ncommercial and political interests acting through the schools and the Press.\nThe fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the fundamental\nemotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science. He who\nknows it not and can no longer wonder, no longer feel amazement, is as good\nas dead, a snuffed-out candle. It was the experience of mystery--even if\nmixed with fear--that engendered religion. A knowledge of the existence of\nsomething we cannot penetrate, of the manifestations of the profoundest\nreason and the most radiant beauty, which are only accessible to our reason in\ntheir most elementary forms--it is this knowledge and this emotion that\nconstitute the truly religious attitude; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a\ndeeply religious man.

I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes\nhis creatures, or has a will of the type of which we are conscious in ourselves.\nAn individual who should survive his physical death is also beyond my\ncomprehension, nor do I wish it otherwise; such notions are for the fears or\nabsurd egoism of feeble souls. Enough for me the mystery of the eternity of\nlife, and the inkling of the marvellous structure of reality, together with the\nsingle-hearted endeavour to comprehend a portion, be it never so tiny, of the\nreason that manifests itself in nature.\nThe Liberty of Doctrine--à propos of the Guntbel Case\nAcademic chairs are many, but wise and noble teachers are few;\nlecture-rooms are numerous and large, but the number of young people who\n8\ngenuinely thirst after truth and justice is small. Nature scatters her common\nwares with a lavish hand, but the choice sort she produces but seldom.\nWe all know that, so why complain? Was it not ever thus and will it not ever\nthus remain? Certainly, and one must take what Nature gives as one finds it.\nBut there is also such a thing as a spirit of the times, an attitude of mind\ncharacteristic of a particular generation, which is passed on from individual to\nindividual and gives a society its particular tone. Each of us has to do his little\nbit towards transforming this spirit of the times.\nCompare the spirit which animated the youth in our universities a hundred\nyears ago with that prevailing to-day. They had faith in the amelioration of\nhuman society, respect for every honest opinion, the tolerance for which our\nclassics had lived and fought. In those days men strove for a larger political\nunity, which at that time was called Germany. It was the students and the\nteachers at the universities who kept these ideals alive.\nTo-day also there is an urge towards social progress, towards tolerance and\nfreedom of thought, towards a larger political unity, which we to-day call\nEurope. But the students at our universities have ceased as completely as their\nteachers to enshrine the hopes and ideals of the nation. Anyone who looks at\nour times coolly and dispassionately must admit this.\nWe are assembled to-day to take stock of ourselves. The external reason for\nthis meeting is the Gumbel case. This apostle of justice has written about\nunexpiated political crimes with devoted industry, high courage, and\nexemplary fairness, and has done the community a signal service by his\nbooks. And this is the man whom the students, and a good many of the staff,\nof his university are to-day doing their best to expel.\nPolitical passion cannot be allowed to go to such lengths. I am convinced that\nevery man who reads Herr Gumbel's books with an open mind will get the\nsame impression from them as I have. Men like him are needed if we are ever\nto build up a healthy political society.\nLet every man judge according to his own standards, by what he has himself\nread, not by what others tell him.\nIf that happens, this Gumbel case, after an unedifying beginning, may still do\ngood.\n9\nGood and Evil\nIt is right in principle that those should be the best loved who have contributed\nmost to the elevation of the human race and human life. But, if one goes on to\nask who they are, one finds oneself in no inconsiderable difficulties. In the\ncase of political, and even of religious, leaders, it is often very doubtful\nwhether they have done more good or harm. Hence I most seriously believe\nthat one does people the best service by giving them some elevating work to\ndo and thus indirectly elevating them. This applies most of all to the great\nartist, but also in a lesser degree to the scientist. To be sure, it is not the fruits\nof scientific research that elevate a man and enrich his nature, but the urge to\nunderstand, the intellectual work, creative or receptive. It would surely be\nabsurd to judge the value of the Talmud, for instance, by its intellectual fruits.\nThe true value of a human being is determined primarily by the measure\nand the sense in which he has attained to liberation from the self.\nSociety and Personality\nWhen we survey our lives and endeavours we soon observe that almost the\nwhole of our actions and desires are bound up with the existence of other\nhuman beings. We see that our whole nature resembles that of the social\nanimals. We eat food that others have grow, wear clothes that others have\nmade, live in houses that others have built. The greater part of our knowledge\nand beliefs has been communicated to us by other people through the medium\nof a language which others have created. Without language our mental\ncapacities wuuld be poor indeed, comparable to those of the higher animals;\nwe have, therefore, to admit that we owe our principal advantage over the\nbeasts to the fact of living in human society. The individual, if left alone from\nbirth would remain primitive and beast-like in his thoughts and feelings to a\ndegree that we can hardly conceive. The individual is what he is and has the\nsignificance that he has not so much in virtue of his individuality, but rather as a\nmember of a great human",

The individual is what he is and has the\nsignificance that he has not so much in virtue of his individuality, but rather as a\nmember of a great human society, which directs his material and spiritual\nexistence from the cradle to the grave.\nA man's value to the community depends primarily on how far his feelings,\nthoughts, and actions are directed towards promoting the good of his fellows.\nWe call him good or bad according to how he stands in this matter. It looks at\nfirst sight as if our estimate of a man depended entirely on his social qualities.\n10\nAnd yet such an attitude would be wrong. It is clear that all the valuable\nthings, material, spiritual, and moral, which we receive from society can be\ntraced back through countless generations to certain creative individuals. The\nuse of fire, the cultivation of edible plants, the steam engine--each was\ndiscovered by one man.\nOnly the individual can think, and thereby create new values for society--nay,\neven set up new moral standards to which the life of the community conforms.\nWithout creative, independently thinking and judging personalities the upward\ndevelopment of society is as unthinkable as the development of the individual\npersonality without the nourishing soil of the community.\nThe health of society thus depends quite as much on the independence of the\nindividuals composing it as on their close political cohesion. It has been said\nvery justly that Græco-Europeo-American culture as a whole, and in\nparticular its brilliant flowering in the Italian Renaissance, which put an end to\nthe stagnation of mediæval Europe, is based on the liberation and comparative\nisolation of the individual.\nLet us now consider the times in which we live. How does society fare, how\nthe individual? The population of the civilized countries is extremely dense as\ncompared with former times; Europe to-day contains about three times as\nmany people as it did a hundred years ago. But the number of great men has\ndecreased out of all proportion. Only a few individuals are known to the\nmasses as personalities, through their creative achievements. Organization has\nto some extent taken the place of the great man, particularly in the technical\nsphere, but also to a very perceptible extent in the scientific.\nThe lack of outstanding figures is particularly striking in the domain of art.\nPainting and music have definitely degenerated and largely lost their popular\nappeal. In politics not only are leaders lacking, but the independence of spent\nand the sense of justice of the citizen have to a great extent declined. The\ndemocratic, parliamentarian regime, which is based on such independence,\nhas in many places been shaken, dictatorships have sprung up and are\ntolerated, because men's sense of the dignity and the rights of the individual is\nno longer strong enough. In two weeks the sheep-like masses can be worked\nup by the newspapers into such a state of excited fury that the men are\nprepared to put on uniform and kill and be billed, for the sake of the worthless\naims of a few interested parties. Compulsory military service seems to me the\nmost disgraceful symptom of that deficiency in personal dignity from which\ncivilized mankind is suffering to-day. No wonder there is no lack of prophets\nwho prophesy the early eclipse of our civilization. I am not one of these\npessimists; I believe that better times are coming. Let me shortly state my\n11\nreasons for such confidence.\nIn my opinion, the present symptoms of decadence are explained by the fact\nthat the development of industry and machinery has made the struggle for\nexistence very much more severe, greatly to the detriment of the free\ndevelopment of the individual. But the development of machinery means that\nless and less work is needed from the individual for the satisfaction of the\ncommunity's needs. A planned division of labour is becoming more and more\nof a crying necessity, and this division will lead to the material security of the\nindividual. This security and the spare time and energy which the individual will\nhave at his command can be made to further his development. In this way the\ncommunity may regain its health, and we will hope that future historians will\nexplain the morbid symptoms of present-day society as the childhood ailments\nof an aspiring humanity, due entirely to the excessive speed at which\ncivilization was advancing.\nAddress at the Grave of H. A. Lorentz\nIt is as the representative of the German-speaking academic world, and in\nparticular the Prussian Academy of Sciences, but above all as a pupil and\naffectionate admirer that I stand at the grave of the greatest and noblest man\nof our times.

Such service demands not only energy, insight, and a\nreputation based on solid achievements, but also a freedom from national\nprejudice and a devotion to the common ends of all, which have become rare\n12\nin our times. I have met no one who combined all these qualities in himself so\nperfectly as H. A. Lorentz. The marvellous thing about the effect of his\npersonality was this: Independent and headstrong natures, such as are\nparticularly common among men of learning, do not readily bow to another's\nwill and for the most part only accept his leadership grudgingly. But, when\nLorentz is in the presidential chair, an atmosphere of happy co-operation is\ninvariably created, however much those present may differ in their aims and\nhabits of thought. The secret of this success lies not only in his swift\ncomprehension of people and things and his marvellous command of\nlanguage, but above all in this, that one feels that his whole heart is in the\nbusiness in hand, and that, when he is at work, he has room for nothing else in\nhis mind. Nothing disarms the recalcitrant so much as this.\nBefore the war Lorentz's activities in the cause of international relations were\nconfined to presiding at congresses of physicists. Particularly noteworthy\namong these were the Solvay Congresses, the first two of which were held at\nBrussels in 1909 and 1912. Then came the European war, which was a\ncrushing blow to all who had the improvement of human relations in general at\nheart. Even before the war was over, and still more after its end, Lorentz\ndevoted himself to the work of reconciliation. His efforts were especially\ndirected towards the re-establishment of fruitful and friendly co-operation\nbetween men of learning and scientific societies. An outsider can hardly\nconceive what uphill work this is. The accumulated resentment of the war\nperiod has not yet died down, and many influential men persist in the\nirreconcilable attitude into which they allowed themselves to be driven by the\npressure of circumstances. Hence Lorentz's efforts resemble those of a doctor\nwith a recalcitrant patient who refuses to take the medicines carefully\nprepared for his benefit.\nBut Lorentz is not to be deterred, once he has recognized a course of action\nas the right one. The moment the war was over, he joined the governing body\nof the \"Conseil de recherche,\" which was founded by the savants of the\nvictorious countries, and from which the savants and learned societies of the\nCentral Powers were excluded. His object in taking this step, which caused\ngreat offence to the academic world of the Central Powers, was to influence\nthis institution in such a way that it could be expanded into something truly\ninternational. He and other right-minded men succeeded, after repeated\nefforts, in securing the removal of the offensive exclusion-clause from the\nstatutes of the \"Conseil.\" The goal, which is the restoration of normal and\nfruitful co-operation between learned societies, is, however, not yet attained,\nbecause the academic world of the Central Powers, exasperated by nearly\nten years of exclusion from practically all international gatherings, has got into\na habit of keeping itself to itself. Now, however, there are good grounds for\n13\nhoping that the ice will soon be broken, thanks to the tactful efforts of\nLorentz, prompted by pure enthusiasm for the good cause.\nLorentz has also devoted his energies to the service of international cultural\nends in another way, by consenting to serve on the League of Nations\nCommission for international intellectual co-operation, which was called into\nexistence some five years ago with Bergson as chairman. For the last year\nLorentz has presided over the Commission, which, with the active support of\nits subordinate, the Paris Institute, is to act as a go-between in the domain of\nintellectual and artistic work among the various spheres of culture. There too\nthe beneficent influence of this intelligent, humane, and modest personality,\nwhose unspoken but faithfully followed advice is, \"Not mastery but service,\"\nwill lead people in the right way.\nMay his example contribute to the triumph of that spirit !\nIn Honour of Arnold Berliner's Seventieth Birthday\n(Arnold Berliner is the editor of the periodical Die\nNaturrvissenschaften.)\nI should like to take this opportunity of telling my friend Berliner and the\nreaders of this paper why I rate him and his work so highly.

The province of\nscientifically determined fact has been enormously extended, theoretical\nknowledge has become vastly more profound in every department of science.\nBut the assimilative power of the human intellect is and remains strictly limited.\nHence it was inevitable that the activity of the individual investigator should be\nconfined to a smaller and smaller section of human knowledge. Worse still, as\na result of this specialization, it is becoming increasingly difficult for even a\nrough general grasp of science as a whole, without which the true spirit of\nresearch is inevitably handicapped, to keep pace with progress. A situation is\ndeveloping similar to the one symbolically represented in the Bible by the\nstory of the Tower of Babel. Every serious scientific worker is painfully\nconscious of this involuntary relegation to an ever-narrowing sphere of\nknowledge, which is threatening to deprive the investigator of his broad\nhorizon and degrade him to the level of a mechanic.\n14\nWe have all suffered under this evil, without making any effort to mitigate it.\nBut Berliner has come to the rescue, as far as the German-speaking world is\nconcerned, in the most admirable way: He saw that the existing popular\nperiodicals were sufficient to instruct and stimulate the layman; but he also\nsaw that a first-class, well-edited organ was needed for the guidance of the\nscientific worker who desired to be put sufficiently au courant of\ndevelopments in scientific problems, methods, and results to be able to form a\njudgment of his own. Through many years of hard work he has devoted\nhimself to this object with great intelligence and no less great determination,\nand done us all, and science, a service for which we cannot be too grateful.\nIt was necessary for him to secure the co-operation of successful scientific\nwriters and induce them to say what they had to say in a form as far as\npossible intelligible to non-specialists. He has often told me of the fights he\nhad in pursuing this object, the difficulties of which he once described to me in\nthe following riddle: Question : What is a scientific author? Answer: A cross\nbetween a mimosa and a porcupine.* Berliner's achievement would have\nbeen impossible but for the peculiar intensity of his longing for a clear,\ncomprehensive view of the largest possible area of scientific country. This\nfeeling also drove him to produce a text-book of physics, the fruit of many\nyears of strenuous work, of which a medical student said to me the other day:\n\"I don't know how I should ever have got a clear idea of the principles of\nmodern physics in the time at my disposal without this book.\"\nBerliner's fight for clarity and comprehensiveness of outlook has done a great\ndeal to bring the problems, methods, and results of science home to many\npeople's minds. The scientific life of our time is simply inconceivable vzthout\nhis paper. It is just as important to make knowledge live and to keep it alive\nas to solve specific problems. We are all conscious of what we owe to\nArnold Berliner.\n *Do not be angry with me for this indiscretion, my dear Berliner. A\n serious-minded man enjoys a good laugh now and then.\nPopper-Lynhaus was more than a brilliant engineer and writer. He was one\nof the few outstanding personalities who embody the conscience of a\ngeneration. He has drummed it into us that society is responsible for the fate\nof every individual and shown us a way to translate the consequent obligation\nof the community into fact. The community or State was no fetish to him; he\nbased its right to demand sacrifices of the individual entirely on its duty to give\nthe individual personality a chance of harmonious development.\n15\nObituary of the Surgeon, M. Katzenstein\nDuring the eighteen years I spent in Berlin I had few close friends, and the\nclosest was Professor Katzenstein. For more than ten years I spent my leisure\nhours during the summer months with him, mostly on his delightful yacht.\nThere we confided our experiences, ambitions, emotions to each other. We\nboth felt that this friendship was not only a blessing because each understood\nthe other, was enriched by him, and found ins him that responsive echo so\nessential to anybody who is truly alive; it also helped to make both of us more\nindependent of external experience, to objectivize it more easily.\nI was a free man, bound neither by many duties nor by harassing\nresponsibilities; my friend, on the contrary, was never free from the grip of\nurgent duties and anxious fears for the fate of those in peril. If, as was\ninvariably the case, he had performed some dangerous operations in the\nmorning, he would ring up on the telephone, immediately before we got into\nthe boat, to enquire after the condition of the patients about whom he was\nworried; I could see how deeply concerned he was for the lives entrusted to\nhis care. It was marvellous that this shackled outward existence did not clip\nthe wings of his soul; his imagination and his sense of humour were\nirrepressible. He never became the typical conscientious North German,\nwhom the Italians in the days of their freedom used to call bestia seriosa. He\nwas sensitive as a youth to the tonic beauty of the lakes and woods of\nBrandenburg, and as he sailed the boat with an expert hand through these\nbeloved and familiar surroundings",

He\nwas sensitive as a youth to the tonic beauty of the lakes and woods of\nBrandenburg, and as he sailed the boat with an expert hand through these\nbeloved and familiar surroundings he opened the secret treasure-chamber of\nhis heart to me--he spoke of his experiments, scientific ideas, and ambitions.\nHow he found time and energy for them was always a mystery to me; but the\npassion for scientific enquiry is not to be crushed by any burdens. The man\nwho is possessed with it perishes sooner than it does.\nThere were two types of problems that engaged his attention. The first forced\nitself on him out of the necessities of his practice. Thus he was always thinking\nout new ways of inducing healthy muscles to take the place of lost ones, by\ningenious transplantation of tendons. He found this remarkably easy, as he\npossessed an uncommonly strong spatial imagination and a remarkably sure\nfeeling for mechanism. How happy he was when he had succeeded in making\nsomebody fit for normal life by putting right the muscular system of his face,\nfoot, or arm! And the same when he avoided an operation, even in cases\nwhich had been sent to him by physicians for surgical treatment in cases of\ngastric ulcer by neutralizing the pepsin. He also set great store by the\ntreatment of peritonitis by an anti-toxic coli-serum which he discovered, and\nrejoiced in the successes he achieved with it. In talking of it he often lamented\n16\nthe fact that this method of treatment was not endorsed by his colleagues.\nThe second group of problems had to do with the common conception of an\nantagonism between different sorts of tissue. He believed that he was here on\nthe track of a general biological principle of widest application, whose\nimplications he followed out with admirable boldness and persistence. Starting\nout from this basic notion he discovered that osteomyelon and periosteum\nprevent each other's growth if they are not separated from each other by\nbone. In this way he succeeded in explaining hitherto inexplicable cases of\nwounds ailing to heal, and in bringing about a cure.\nThis general notion of the antagonism of the tissues, especially of epithelium\nand connective tissue, was the subject to which he devoted his scientific\nenergies, especially in the last ten years of his life. Experiments on animals and\na systematic investigation of the growth of tissues in a nutrient fluid were\ncarried out side by side. How thankful he was, with his hands tied as they\nwere by his duties, to have found such an admirable and infinitely enthusiastic\nfellow-worker in Frälein Knake! He succeeded in securing wonderful results\nbearing on the factors which favour the growth of epithelium at the expense of\nthat of connective tissue, results which may well be of decisive importance for\nthe study of cancer. He also had the pleasure of inspiring his own son to\nbecome his intelligent and independent fellow-worker, and of exciting the\nwarm interest and co-operation of Sauerbruch just in the last years of his life,\nso that he was able to die with the consoling thought that his life's work would\nnot perish, but would be vigorously continued on the lines he had laid down.\nI for my part am grateful to fate for having given me this man, with his\ninexhaustible goodness and high creative gifts, for a friend.\nCongratulations to Dr. Solf\nI am delighted to be able to offer you, Dr. Solf, the heartiest congratulations,\nthe congratulations of Lessing College, of which you have become an\nindispensable pillar, and the congratulations of all who are convinced of the\nneed for close contact between science and art and the public which is hungry\nfor spiritual nourishment.\nYou have not hesitated to apply your energies to a field where there are no\nlaurels to be won, but quiet, loyal work to be done in the interests of the\ngeneral standard of intellectual and spiritual life, which is in peculiar danger\nto-day owing to a variety of circumstances. Exaggerated respect for athletics,\nan excess of coarse impressions which the complications of life through the\ntechnical discoveries of recent years has brought with it, the increased severity\n17\nof the struggle for existence due to the economic crisis, the brutalization of\npolitical life--all these factors are hostile to the ripening of the character and\nthe desire for real culture, and stamp our age as barbarous, materialistic, and\nsuperficial. Specialization in every sphere of intellectual work is producing an\neverwidening gulf between the intellectual worker and the non-specialist,\nwhich makes it more difficult for the life of the nation to be fertilized and\nenriched by the achievements of art and science.\nBut contact between the intellectual and the masses must not be lost. It is\nnecessary for the elevation of society and no less so for renewing the strength\nof the intellectual worker; for the flower of science does not grow in the\ndesert. For this reason you, Herr Solf, have devoted a portion of your\nenergies to Lessing College, and we are grateful to you for doing so. And we\nwish you further success and happiness in your work for this noble cause.\nOf Wealth\nI am absolutely convinced that no wealth in the world can help humanity\nforward, even in the hands of the most devoted worker in this cause.

It is clever, well observed, honest, it stands on its\n own feet up to a point, and yet it is so typically feminine, by\n which I mean derivative and vitiated by personal rancour. I\n suffered exactly the same treatment at the hands of my teachers,\n who disliked me for my independence and passed me over\n when they wanted assistants (I must admit that I was somewhat\n less of a model student than you). But it would not have been\n worth my while to write anything about my school life, still less\n would I have liked to be responsible for anyone's printing or\n actually reading it. Besides, one always cuts a poor figure if one\n18\n complains about others who are struggling for their place in the\n sun too after their own fashion.\n Therefore pocket your temperament and keep your manuscript\n for your sons and daughters, m order that they may derive\n consolation from it and--not give a damn for what their teachers\n tell them or think of them.\n Incidentally I am only coming to Princeton to research, not to\n teach. There is too much education altogether, especially in\n American schools. The only rational way of educating is to be an\n example--of what to avoid, if one can't be the other sort.\n With best wishes.\nTo the Schoolchildren of Japan\nIn sending this greeting to you Japanese schoolchildren, I can lay claim to a\nspecial right to do so. For I have myself visited your beautiful country, seen its\ncities and houses, its mountains and woods, and in them Japanese boys who\nhad learnt from them to love their country. A big fat book full of coloured\ndrawings by Japanese children lies always on my table.\nIf you get my message of greeting from all this distance, bethink you that ours\nis the first age in history to bring about friendly and understanding intercourse\nbetween people of different countries; in former times nations passed their\nlives in mutual ignorance, and in fact hated or feared one another. May the\nspirit of brotherly understanding gain ground more and more among them.\nWith this in mind I, an old man, greet you Japanese schoolchildren from afar\nand hope that your generation may some day put mine to shame.\nTeachers and Pupils\nAn address to children\n (The principal art of the teacher is to awaken the joy in creation\n and knowledge.)\nMy dear Children,\nI rejoice to see you before me to-day, happy youth of a sunny and fortunate\nland.\n19\nBear in mind that the wonderful things you learn in your schools are the work\nof many generations, produced by enthusiastic effort and infinite labour in\nevery country of the world. All this is put into your hands as your inheritance\nin order that you may receive it, honour it, add to it, and one day faithfully\nhand it on to your children. Thus do we mortals achieve immortality in the\npermanent things which we create in common.\nIf you always keep that in mind you will find a meaning in life and work and\nacquire the right attitude towards other nations and ages.\nParadise Lost\nAs late as the seventeenth century the savants and artists of all Europe were\nso closely united by the bond of a common ideal that co-operation between\nthem was scarcely affected by political events. This unity was further\nstrengthened by the general use of the Latin language.\nTo-day we look back at this state of affairs as at a lost paradise. The passions\nof nationalism have destroyed this community of the intellect, and the Latin\nlanguage, which once united the whole world, is dead. The men of learning\nhave become the chief mouthpieces of national tradition and lost their sense of\nan intellectual commonwealth.\nNowadays we are faced with the curious fact that the politicians, the practical\nmen of affairs, have become the exponents of international ideas. It is they\nwho have created the League of Nations.\nReligion and Science\nEverything that the human race has done and thought is concerned with the\nsatisfaction of felt needs and the assuagement of pain. One has to keep this\nconstantly in mind if one wishes to understand spiritual movements and their\ndevelopment. Feeling and desire are the motive forces behind all human\nendeavour and human creation, in however exalted a guise the latter may\npresent itself to us. Now what are the feelings and needs that have led men to\nreligious thought and belief in the widest sense of the words? A little\nconsideration will suffice to show us that the most varying emotions preside\nover the birth of religious thought and experience. With primitive man it is\nabove all fear that evokes religious notions--fear of hunger, wild beasts,\nsickness, death. Since at this stage of existence understanding of causal\nconnexions is usually poorly developed, the human mind creates for itself\nmore or less analogous beings on whose wills and actions these fearful\n20\nhappenings depend.

Since at this stage of existence understanding of causal\nconnexions is usually poorly developed, the human mind creates for itself\nmore or less analogous beings on whose wills and actions these fearful\n20\nhappenings depend. One's object now is to secure the favour of these beings\nby carrying out actions and offering sacrifices which, according to the tradition\nhanded down from generation to generation, propitiate them or make them\nwell disposed towards a mortal. I am speaking now of the religion of fear.\nThis, though not created, is in an important degree stabilized by the formation\nof a special priestly caste which sets up as a mediator between the people and\nthe beings they fear, and erects a hegemony on this basis. In many cases the\nleader or ruler whose position depends on other factors, or a privileged class,\ncombines priestly functions with its secular authority in order to make the\nlatter more secure; or the political rulers and the priestly caste make common\ncause in their own interests.\nThe social feelings are another source of the crystallization of religion. Fathers\nand mothers and the leaders of larger human communities are mortal and\nfallible. The desire for guidance, love, and support prompts men to form the\nsocial or moral conception of God. This is the God of Providence who\nprotects, disposes, rewards, and punishes, the God who, according to the\nwidth of the believer's outlook, loves and cherishes the life of the tribe or of\nthe human race, or even life as such, the comforter in sorrow and unsatisfied\nlonging, who preserves the souls of the dead. This is the social or moral\nconception of God.\nThe Jewish scriptures admirably illustrate the development from the religion of\nfear to moral religion, which is continued in the New Testament. The religions\nof all civilized peoples, especially the peoples of the Orient, are primarily\nmoral religions. The development from a religion of fear to moral religion is a\ngreat step in a nation's life. That primitive religions are based entirely on fear\nand the religions of civilized peoples purely on morality is a prejudice against\nwhich we must be on our guard. The truth is that they are all intermediate\ntypes, with this reservation, that on the higher levels of social life the religion of\nmorality predominates.\nCommon to all these types is the anthropomorphic character of their\nconception of God. Only individuals of exceptional endowments and\nexceptionally high-minded communities, as a general rule, get in any real sense\nbeyond this level. But there is a third state of religious experience which\nbelongs to all of them, even though it is rarely found in a pure form, and which\nI will call cosmic religious feeling. It is very difficult to explain this feeling to\nanyone who is entirely without it, especially as there is no anthropomorphic\nconception of God corresponding to it.\nThe individual feels the nothingness of human desires and aims and the\nsublimity and marvellous order which reveal themselves both in nature and in\n21\nthe world of thought. He looks upon individual existence as a sort of prison\nand wants to experience the universe as a single significant whole. The\nbeginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear in earlier stages of\ndevelopment--e.g., in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the\nProphets. Buddhism, as we have learnt from the wonderful writings of\nSchopenhauer especially, contains a much stronger element of it.\nThe religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of\nreligious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man's\nimage; so that there can be no Church whose central teachings are based on\nit. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who\nwere filled with the highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases\nregarded by their contemporaries as Atheists, sometimes also as saints.\nLooked at in this light, men like Democritus, Francis of Assisi, and Spinoza\nare closely akin to one another.\nHow can cosmic religious feeling be communicated from one person to\nanother, if it can give rise to no definite notion of a God and no theology? In\nmy view, it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this\nfeeling and keep it alive in those who are capable of it.\nWe thus arrive at a conception of the relation of science to religion very\ndifferent from the usual one. When one views the matter historically one is\ninclined to look upon science and religion as irreconcilable antagonists, and\nfor a very obvious reason. The man who is thoroughly convinced of the\nuniversal operation of the law of causation cannot for a moment entertain the\nidea of a being who interferes in the course of events--that is, if he takes the\nhypothesis of causality really seriously. He has no use for the religion of fear\nand equally little for social or moral religion. A God who rewards and\npunishes is inconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man's actions are\ndetermined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God's eyes he cannot\nbe responsible, any more than an inanimate object is responsible for the\nmotions it goes through. Hence science has been charged with undermining\nmorality, but the charge is unjust. A man's ethical behaviour should be based\neffectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is\nnecessary",

A man's ethical behaviour should be based\neffectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is\nnecessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by\nfear and punishment and hope of reward after death.\nIt is therefore easy to see why the Churches have always fought science and\npersecuted its devotees. On the other hand, I maintain that cosmic religious\nfeeling is the strongest and noblest incitement to scientific research. Only those\nwho realize the immense efforts and, above all, the devotion which pioneer\nwork in theoretical science demands, can grasp the strength of the emotion\n22\nout of which alone such work, remote as it is from the immediate realities of\nlife, can issue. What a deep conviction of the rationality of the universe and\nwhat a yearning to understand, were it but a feeble reflection of the mind\nrevealed in this world, Kepler and Newton must have had to enable them to\nspend years of solitary labour in disentangling the principles of celestial\nmechanics! Those whose acquaintance with scientific research is derived\nchiefly from its practical results easily develop a completely false notion of the\nmentality of the men who, surrounded by a sceptical world, have shown the\nway to those like-minded with themselves, scattered through the earth and the\ncenturies. Only one who has devoted his life to similar ends can have a vivid\nrealization of what has inspired these men and given them the strength to\nremain true to their purpose in spite of countless failures. It is cosmic religious\nfeeling that gives a man strength of this sort. A contemporary has said, not\nunjustly, that in this materialistic age of ours the serious scientific workers are\nthe only profoundly religious people.\nThe Religiousness of Science\nYou will hardly find one among the profounder sort of scientific minds without\na peculiar religious feeling of his own. But it is different from the religion of the\nnaive man. For the latter God is a being from whose care one hopes to benefit\nand whose punishment one fears; a sublimation of a feeling similar to that of a\nchild for its father, a being to whom one stands to some extent in a personal\nrelation, however deeply it may be tinged with awe.\nBut the scientist is possessed by the sense of universal causation. The future,\nto him, is every whit as necessary and determined as the past. There is nothing\ndivine about morality, it is a purely human affair. His religious feeling takes the\nform of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals\nan intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic\nthinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection. This\nfeeling is the guiding principle of his life and work, in so far as he succeeds in\nkeeping himself from the shackles of selfish desire. It is beyond question\nclosely akin to that which has possessed the religious geniuses of all ages.\nThe Plight of Science\nThe German-speaking countries are menaced by a danger to which those in\nthe know are in duty bound to call attention in the most emphatic terms. The\neconomic stress which political events bring in their train does not hit\neverybody equally hard. Among the hardest hit are the institutions and\nindividuals whose material existence depends directly on the State. To this\ncategory belong the scientific institutions and workers on whose work not\n23\nmerely the well-being of science but also the position occupied by Germany\nand Austria in the scale of culture very largely depends.\nTo grasp the full gravity of the situation it is necessary to bear in mind the\nfollowing consideration. In times of crisis people are generally blind to\neverything outside their immediate necessities. For work which is directly\nproductive of material wealth they will pay. But science, if it is to flourish, must\nhave no practical end in view. As a general rule, the knowledge and the\nmethods which it creates only subserve practical ends indirectly and, in many\ncases, not till after the lapse of several generations. Neglect of science leads\nto a subsequent dearth of intellectual workers able, in virtue of their\nindependent outlook and judgment, to blaze new trails for industry or adapt\nthemselves to new situations. Where scientific enquiry is stunted the\nintellectual life of the nation dries up, which means the withering of many\npossibilities of future development. This is what we have to prevent. Now that\nthe State has been weakened as a result of nonpolitical causes, it is up to the\neconomically stronger members of the community to come to the rescue\ndirectly, and prevent the decay of scientific life.\nFar-sighted men with a clear understanding of the situation have set up\ninstitutions by which scientific work of every sort is to be kept going in\nGermany and Austria. Help to make these efforts a real success. In my\nteaching work I see with admiration that economic troubles have not yet\nsucceeded in stifling the will and the enthusiasm for scientific research. Far\nfrom it! Indeed, it looks as if our disasters had actually quickened the\ndevotion to non-material goods.

See to it that the will-power\nand the talents of the youth of to-day do not perish to the grievous hurt of the\ncommunity as a whole.\nFascism and Science\nA letter to Signor Rocco, Minister of State, Rome.\n My dear Sir,\n Two of the most eminent and respected men of science in Italy\n have applied to me in their difficulties of conscience and\n requested me to write to you with the object of preventing, if\n possible, a piece of cruel persecution with which men of learning\n are threatened in Italy. I refer to a form of oath in which fidelity\n to the Fascist system is to be promised. The burden of my\n request is that you should please advise Signor Mussolini to\n24\n spare the flower of Italy's intellect this humiliation.\n However much our political convictions may differ, I know that\n we agree on one point: in the progressive achievements of the\n European mind both of us see and love our highest good. Those\n achievements are based on the freedom of thought and of\n teaching, on the principle that the desire for truth must take\n precedence of all other desires. It was this basis alone that\n enabled our civilization to take its rise in Greece and to celebrate\n its rebirth in Italy at the Renaissance. This supreme good has\n been paid for by the martyr's blood of pure and great men, for\n whose sake Italy is still loved and reverenced to-day.\n Far be it from me to argue with you about what inroads on\n human liberty may be justified by reasons of State. But the\n pursuit of scientific truth, detached from the practical interests of\n everyday life, ought to be treated as sacred by every\n Government, and it is in the highest interests of all that honest\n servants of truth should be left in peace. This is also undoubtedly\n in the interests of the Italian State and its prestige in the eyes of\n the world.\n Hoping that my request will not fall on deaf ears, I am, etc.\n A. E.\nInterviewers\nTo be called to account publicly for everything one has said, even in jest, an\nexcess of high spirits, or momentary anger, fatal as it must be in the end, is yet\nup to a point reasonable and natural. But to be called to account publicly for\nwhat others have said in one's name, when one cannot defend oneself, is\nindeed a sad predicament. \"But who suffers such a dreadful fate?\" you will\nask. Well, everyone who is of sufficient interest to the public to be pursued by\ninterviewers. You smile incredulously, but I have had plenty of direct\nexperience and will tell you about it.\nImagine the following situation. One morning a reporter comes to you and\nasks you in a friendly way to tell him something about your friend N. At first\nyou no doubt feel something approaching indignation at such a proposal. But\nyou soon discover that there is no escape. If you refuse to say anything, the\nman writes: \"I asked one of N.'s supposedly best friends about him. But he\nprudently avoided my questions. This in itself enables the reader to draw the\n25\ninevitable conclusions.\" There is, therefore, no escape, and you give the\nfollowing information: \"Mr. N. is a cheerful, straightforward man, much liked\nby all his friends. He can find a bright side to any situation. His enterprise and\nindustry know no bounds; his job takes up his entire energies. He is devoted\nto his family and lays everything he possesses at his wife's feet. . . \"\nNow for the reporter's version : \"Mr. N. takes nothing very seriously and has\na gift for making himself liked, particularly as he carefully cultivates a hearty\nand ingratiating manner. He is so completely a slave to his job that he has no\ntime for the considerations of any non-personal subject or for any mental\nactivity outside it. He spoils his wife unbelievably and is utterly under her\nthumb. . .\"\nA real reporter would make it much more spicy, but I expect this will be\nenough for you and your friend N. He reads this, and some more like it, in the\npaper next morning, and his rage against you knows no bounds, however\ncheerful and benevolent his natural disposition may be. The injury done to him\ngives you untold pain, especially as you are really fond of him.\nWhat's your next step, my friend? If you know, tell me quickly, so that I may\nadopt your method with all speed.\nThanks to America\nMr. Mayor, Ladies, and Gentlemen,\nThe splendid reception which you have accorded to me to-day puts me to the\nblush in so far as it is meant for me personally, but it gives me all the more\npleasure in so far as it is meant for me as a representative of pure science. For\nthis gathering is an outward and visible sign that the world is no longer prone\nto regard material power and wealth as the highest goods. It is gratifying that\nmen should feel an urge to proclaim this in an official way.\nIn the wonderful two months which I have been privileged to spend in your\nmidst in this fortunate land, I have had many opportunities of observing what a\nhigh value men of action and of practical life attach to the efforts of science; a\ngood few of them have placed a considerable proportion of their",

I may be permitted to express the\nhope that this internationalism of the American nation, which proceeds from a\nhigh sense of responsibility, will very soon extend itself to the sphere of\npolitics. For without the active co-operation of the great country of the United\nStates in the business of regulating international relations, all efforts directed\ntowards this important end are bound to remain more or less ineffectual.\nI thank you most heartily for this magnificent reception and, in particular, the\nmen of learning in this country for the cordial and friendly welcome I have\nreceived from them. I shall always look back on these two months with\npleasure and gratitude.\nThe University Course at Davos\nSenalores boni viri, senatus autem bestia. So a friend of mine, a Swiss\nprofessor, once wrote in his irritable way to a university faculty which had\nannoyed him. Communities tend to be less guided than individuals by\nconscience and a sense of responsibility. What a fruitful source of suffering to\nmankind this fact is! It is the cause of wars and every kind of oppression,\nwhich fill the earth with pain, sighs, and bitterness.\nAnd yet nothing truly valuable can be achieved except by the unselfish\nco-operation of many individuals. Hence the man of good will is never happier\nthan when some communal enterprise is afoot and is launched at the cost of\nheavy sacrifices, with the single object of promoting life and culture.\nSuch pure joy was mine when I heard about the university courses at Davos.\nA work of rescue is being carried out there, with intelligence and a wise\nmoderation, which is based on a grave need, though it may not be a need that\nis immediately obvious to everyone. Many a young man goes to this valley\nwith his hopes fixed on the healing power of its sunny mountains and regains\nhis bodily health. But thus withdrawn for long periods from the will-hardening\ndiscipline of normal work and a prey to morbid reflection on his physical\ncondition, he easily loses the power of mental effort and the sense of being\nable to hold his own in the struggle for existence. He becomes a sort of\nhot-house plant and, when his body is cured, often finds it difficult to get back\n27\nto normal life. Interruption of intellectual training in the formative period of\nyouth is very apt to leave a gap which can hardly be filled later.\nYet, as a general rule, intellectual work in moderation, so far from retarding\ncure, indirectly helps it forward, just as moderate physical work does. It is in\nthis knowledge that the university courses are being instituted, with the object\nnot merely of preparing these young people for a profession but of stimulating\nthem to intellectual activity as such. They are to provide work, training, and\nhygiene in the sphere of the mind.\nLet us not forget that this enterprise is admirably calculated to establish such\nrelations between members of different nations as are favourable to the\ngrowth of a common European feeling. The effects of the new institution in this\ndirection are likely to be all the more advantageous from the fact that the\ncircumstances of its birth rule out every sort of political purpose. The best\nway to serve the cause of internationalism is by co-operating in some\nlife-giving work.\n>From all these points of view I rejoice that the energy and intelligence of the\nfounders of the university courses at Davos have already attained such a\nmeasure of success that the enterprise has outgrown the troubles of infancy.\nMay it prosper, enriching the inner lives of numbers of admirable human\nbeings and rescuing many from the poverty of sanatorium life!\nCongratulations to a Critic\nTo see with one's own eyes, to feel and judge without succumbing to the\nsuggestive power of the fashion of the day, to be able to express what one\nhas seen and felt in a snappy sentence or even in a cunningly wrought\nword--is that not glorious? Is it not a proper subject for congratulation?\nGreeting to G.

To-day I salute with sincere emotion the supreme master of this\nmethod, who has delighted--and educated--us all.\n28\nSome Notes on my American Impressions\nI must redeem my promise to say something about my impressions of this\ncountry. That is not altogether easy for me. For it is not easy to take up the\nattitude of an impartial observer when one is received with such kindness and\nundeserved respect as I have been in America. First of all let me say\nsomething on this head.\nThe cult of individual personalities is always, in my view, unjustified. To be\nsure, nature distributes her gifts variously among her children. But there are\nplenty of the well-endowed ones too, thank God, and I am firmly convinced\nthat most of them live quiet, unregarded lives. It strikes me as unfair, and even\nin bad taste, to select a few of them fur boundless admiration, attributing\nsuperhuman powers of mind and character to them. This has been my fate,\nand the contrast between the popular estimate of my powers and\nachievements and the reality is simply grotesque. The consciousness of this\nextraordinary state of affairs would be unbearable but for one great consoling\nthought: it is a welcome symptom in an age which is commonly denounced as\nmaterialistic, that it makes heroes of men whose ambitions lie wholly in the\nintellectual and moral sphere. This proves that knowledge and justice are\nranked above wealth and power by a large section of the human race. My\nexperience teaches me that this idealistic outlook is particularly prevalent in\nAmerica, which is usually decried as a particularly materialistic country. After\nthis digression I come to my proper theme, in the hope that no more weight\nwill be attached to my modest remarks than they deserve.\nWhat first strikes the visitor with amazement is the superiority of this country\nin matters of technics and organization. Objects of everyday use are more\nsolid than in Europe, houses infinitely more convenient in arrangement.\nEverything is designed to save human labour. Labour is expensive, because\nthe country is sparsely inhabited in comparison with its natural resources. The\nhigh price of labour was the stimulus which evoked the marvellous\ndevelopment of technical devices and methods of work. The opposite\nextreme is illustrated by over-populated China or India, where the low price\nof labour has stood in the way of the development of machinery. Europe is\nhalf-way between the two. Once the machine is sufficiently highly developed it\nbecomes cheaper in the end than the cheapest labour. Let the Fascists in\nEurope, who desire on narrow-minded political grounds to see their own\nparticular countries more densely populated, take heed of this. The anxious\ncare with which the United States keep out foreign goods by means of\nprohibitive tariffs certainly contrasts oddly with this notion.&hellip;But an\n29\ninnocent visitor must not be expected to rack his brains too much, and, when\nall is said and done, it is not absolutely certain that every question admits of a\nrational answer.\nThe second thing that strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life.\nThe smile on the faces of the people in photographs is symbolical of one of\nthe American's greatest assets. He is friendly, confident, optimistic,\nand--without envy. The European finds intercourse with Americans easy and\nagreeable.\nCompared with the American, the European is more critical, more\nself-conscious, less goodhearted and helpful, more isolated, more fastidious in\nhis amusements and his reading, generally more or less of a pessimist.\nGreat importance attaches to the material comforts of life, and peace,\nfreedom from care, security are all sacrificed to them. The American lives for\nambition, the future, more than the European. Life for him is always becoming,\nnever being. In this respect he is even further removed from the Russian and\nthe Asiatic than the European is. But there is another respect in which he\nresembles the Asiatic more than the European does: he is lest of an\nindividualist than the European--that is, from the psychological, not the\neconomic, point of view.\nMore emphasis is laid on the \"we\" than the \"I.\" As a natural corollary of this,\ncustom and convention are very powerful, and there is much more uniformity\nboth in outlook on life and in moral and æsthetic ideas among Americans than\namong Europeans. This fact is chiefly responsible for America's economic\nsuperiority over Europe. Co-operation and the division of labour are carried\nthrough more easily and with less friction than in Europe, whether in the\nfactory or the university or in private good works. This social sense may be\npartly due to the English tradition.\nIn apparent contradiction to this stands the fact that the activities of the State\nare comparatively restricted as compared with Europe. The European is\nsurprised to find the telegraph, the telephone, the railways, and the schools\npredominantly in private hands. The more social attitude of the individual,\nwhich I mentioned just now, makes this possible here. Another consequence\nof this attitude is that the extremely unequal distribution of property leads to\nno intolerable hardships. The social conscience of the rich man is much more",

The more social attitude of the individual,\nwhich I mentioned just now, makes this possible here. Another consequence\nof this attitude is that the extremely unequal distribution of property leads to\nno intolerable hardships. The social conscience of the rich man is much more\nhighly developed than in Europe. He considers himself obliged as a matter of\ncourse to place a large portion of his wealth, and often of his own energies\ntoo, at the disposal of the community, and public opinion, that all-powerful\nforce, imperiously demands it of him. Hence the most important cultural\n30\nfunctions can be left to private enterprise, and the part played by the State in\nthis country is, comparatively, a very restricted one.\nThe prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by\nthe Prohibition laws. For nothing is more destructive of respect for the\ngovernment and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be\nenforced. It is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this\ncountry is closely connected with this.\nThere is also another way in which Prohibition, in my opinion, has led to the\nenfeeblement of the State. The public-house is a place which gives people a\nchance to exchange views and ideas on public affairs. As far as I can see,\npeople here have no chance of doing this, the result being that the Press,\nwhich is mostly controlled by definite interests, has an excessive influence over\npublic opinion.\nThe over-estimation of money is still greater in this country than in Europe, but\nappears to me to be on the decrease. It is at last beginning to be realized that\ngreat wealth is not necessary for a happy and satisfactory life.\nAs regards artistic matters, I have been genuinely impressed by the good taste\ndisplayed in the modern buildings and in articles of common use; on the other\nhand, the visual arts and music have little place in the life of the nation as\ncompared with Europe.\nI have a warm admiration for the achievements of American institutes of\nscientific research. We are unjust in attempting to ascribe the increasing\nsuperiority of American research-work exclusively to superior wealth; zeal,\npatience, a spirit of comradeship, and a talent for co-operation play an\nimportant part in its successes. One more observation to finish up with. The\nUnited States is the most powerful technically advanced country in the world\nto-day. Its influence on the shaping of international relations is absolutely\nincalculable. But America is a large country and its people have so far not\nshown much interest in great international problems, among which the\nproblem of disarmament occupies first place today. This must be changed, if\nonly in the essential interests of the Americans. The last war has shown that\nthere are no longer any barriers between the continents and that the destinies\nof all countries are closely interwoven. The people of this country must realize\nthat they have a great responsibility in the sphere of international politics. The\npart of passive spectator is unworthy of this country and is bound in the end\nto lead to disaster all round.\n31\nReply to the Women of America\nAn American Women's League felt called upon to protest against\nEinstein's visit to their country. They received the following answer.\nNever yet have I experienced from the fair sex such energetic rejection of all\nadvances; or, if I have, never from so many at once.\nBut are they not quite right, these watchful citizenesses? Why should one open\none's doors to a person who devours hard-boiled capitalists with as much\nappetite and gusto as the Cretan Minotaur in days gone by devoured luscious\nGreek maidens, and on top of that is low-down enough to reject every sort of\nwar, except the unavoidable war with one's own wife? Therefore give heed to\nyour clever and patriotic women-folk and remember that the Capitol of\nmighty Rome was once saved by the cackling of its faithful geese.\nII\n Politics and Pacifism\nPeace\nThe importance of securing international peace was recognized by the really\ngreat men of former generations. But the technical advances of our times have\nturned this ethical postulate into a matter of life and death for civilized mankind\nto-day, and made the taking of an active part in the solution of the problem of\npeace a moral duty which no conscientious man can shirk.\nOne has to realize that the powerful industrial groups concerned in the\nmanufacture of arms are doing their best in all countries to prevent the\npeaceful settlement of international disputes, and that rulers can achieve this\ngreat end only if they are sure of the vigorous support of the majority of their\npeoples. In these days of democratic government the fate of the nations hangs\non themselves; each individual must always bear that in mind.\nThe Pacifist Problem\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nI am very glad of this opportunity of saying a few words to you about the\n32\nproblem of pacificism. The course of events in the last few years has once\nmore shown us how little we are justified in leaving the struggle against\narmaments and against the war spirit to the Governments. On the other hand,\nthe formation of large organizations with a large membership can of itself bring\nus very little nearer to our goal. In my opinion, the best method in this case is\nthe violent one of conscientious objection, with the aid of organizations for\ngiving moral and material support to the courageous conscientious objectors\nin each country.

In this way we may succeed in making the problem of\npacificism an acute one, a real struggle which attracts forceful natures. It is an\nillegal struggle, but a struggle for people's real rights against their governments\nin so far as the latter demand criminal acts of the citizen.\nMany who think themselves good pacifists will jib at this out-and-out\npacifism, on patriotic grounds. Such people are not to be relied on in the hour\nof crisis, as the World War amply proved.\nI am most grateful to you for according me an opportunity to give you my\nviews in person.\nAddress to the Students' Disarmament Meeting\nPreceding generations have presented us, in a highly developed science and\nmechanical knowledge, with a most valuable gift which carries with it\npossibilities of making our life free and beautiful such as no previous\ngeneration has enjoyed. But this gift also brings with it dangers to our\nexistence as great as any that have ever threatened it.\nThe destiny of civilized humanity depends more than ever on the moral forces\nit is capable of generating. Hence the task that confronts our age is certainly\nno easier than the tasks our immediate predecessors successfully performed.\nThe foodstuffs and other goods which the world needs can be produced in far\nfewer hours of work than formerly. But this has made the problem of the\ndivision of labour and the distribution of the goods produced far more difficult.\nWe all feel that the free play of economic forces, the unregulated and\nunrestrained pursuit of wealth and power by the individual, no longer leads\nautomatically to a tolerable solution of these problems. Production, labour,\nand distribution need to be organized on a definite plan, in order to prevent\nvaluable productive energies from being thrown away and sections of the\npopulation from becoming impoverished and relapsing into savagery. If\nunrestricted sacro egoismo leads to disastrous consequences in economic\nlife, it is a still worse guide in international relations. The development of\n33\nmechanical methods of warfare is such that human life will become intolerable\nif people do not before long discover a way of preventing war. The\nimportance of this object is only equalled by the inadequacy of the attempts\nhitherto made to attain it.\nPeople seek to minimize the danger by limitation of armaments and restrictive\nrules for the conduct of war. But war is not like a parlour-game in which the\nplayers loyally stick to the rules. Where life and death are at stake, rules and\nobligations go by the board. Only the absolute repudiation of all war is of any\nuse here. The creation of an international court of arbitration is not enough.\nThere must be treaties guaranteeing that the decisions of this court shall be\nmade effective by all the nations acting in concert. Without such a guarantee\nthe nations will never have the courage to disarm seriously.\nSuppose, for example, that the American, English, German, and French\nGovernments insisted on the Japanese Government's putting an immediate\nstop to their warlike operations in China, under pain of a complete economic\nboycott. Do you suppose that any Japanese Government would be found\nready to take the responsibility of plunging its country into such a perilous\nadventure? Then why is it not done? Why must every individual and every\nnation tremble for their existence? Because each seeks his own wretched\nmomentary advantage and refuses to subordinate it to the welfare and\nprosperity of the community.\nThat is why I began by telling you that the fate of the human race was more\nthan ever dependent on its moral strength to-day. The way to a joyful and\nhappy state is through renunciation and self-limitation everywhere.\nWhere can the strength for such a process come from? Only from those who\nhave had the chance in their early years to fortify their minds and broaden\ntheir outlook through study. Thus we of the older generation look to you and\nhope that you will strive with all your might to achieve what was denied to us.\nTo Sigmund Freud\n Dear Professor Freud,\n It is admirable the way the longing to perceive the truth has\n overcome every other desire in you. You have shown with\n irresistible clearness how inseparably the combative and\n destructive instincts are bound up with the amative and vital ones\n in the human psyche. At the same time a deep yearning for that\n great consummation, the internal and external liberation of\n34\n mankind from war, shines out from the ruthless logic of your\n expositions. This has been the declared aim of all those who\n have been honoured as moral and spiritual leaders beyond the\n limits of their own time and country without exception, from\n Jesus Christ to Goethe and Kant. Is it not significant that such\n men have been universally accepted as leaders, in spite of the\n fact that their efforts to mould the course of human affairs were\n attended with but small success?\n I am convinced that the great men--those whose achievements,\n even though in a restricted sphere, set them above their\n fellows--are animated to an overwhelming extent by the same\n ideals. But they have little influence on the course of political\n events.

The intellectual èlite have no direct\n influence on the history of nations in these days; their lack of\n cohesion prevents them from taking a direct part in the solution\n of contemporary problems.

This international association,\n whose members would need to keep in touch with each other by\n a constant interchange of opinions, might, by defining its attitude\n in the Press--responsibility always resting with the signatories on\n any given occasion--acquire a considerable and salutary moral\n influence over the settlement of political questions.

Finally, I believe\n35\n that an association formed of persons such as I have described,\n each highly esteemed in his own line, would be just the thing to\n give valuable moral support to those elements in the League of\n Nations which are really working for the great object for which\n that institution exists.\n I had rather put these proposals to you than to anyone else in the\n world, because you are least of all men the dupe of your desires\n and because your critical judgment is supported by a most\n earnest sense of responsibility.\nCompulsory Service\nFrom a letter\nInstead of permission being given to Germany to introduce compulsory\nservice it ought to be taken away from everybody else: in future none but\nmercenary armies should be permitted, the size and equipment of which\nshould be discussed at Geneva. This would be better for France than to have\nto permit compulsory service in Germany. The fatal psychological effect of the\nmilitary education of the people and the violation of the individual's rights\nwhich it involves would thus be avoided.\nMoreover, it would be much easier for two countries which had agreed to\ncompulsory arbitration for the settlement of all disputes arising out of their\nmutual relations to combine their military establishments of mercenaries into a\nsingle organization with a mixed staff. This would mean a financial relief and\nincreased security for both of them. Such a process of amalgamation might\nextend to larger and larger combinations, and finally lead to an \"international\npolice,\" which would be bound gradually to degenerate as international\nsecurity increased.\nWill you discuss this proposal with our friends by way of setting the ball\nrolling? Of course I do not in the least insist on this particular proposal. But I\ndo think it essential that we should come forward with a positive programme;\na merely negative policy is unlikely to produce any practical results.\nGermany and France\nMutual trust and co-operation between France and Germany can come about\nonly if the French demand for security against military attack is satisfied. But\nshould France frame demands in accordance with this, such a step would\n36\ncertainly be taken very ill in Germany.\nA procedure something like the following seems, however, to be possible. Let\nthe German Government of its own free will propose to the French that they\nshould jointly make representations to the League of Nations that it should\nsuggest to all member States to bind themselves to the following:--\n(1) To submit to every decision of the international court of arbitration.\n(2) To proceed with all its economic and military force, in concert with the\nother members of the League, against any State which breaks the peace or\nresists an international decision made in the interests of world peace.\nArbitration\nSystematic disarmament within a short period. This is possible only in\ncombination with the guarantee of all for the security of each separate nation,\nbased on a permanent court of arbitration independent of governments.\nUnconditional obligation of all countries not merely to accept the decisions of\nthe court of arbitration but also to give effect to them.\nSeparate courts of arbitration for Europe with Africa, America, and Asia\n(Australia to be apportioned to one of these). A joint court of arbitration for\nquestions involving issues that cannot be settled within the limits of any one of\nthese three regions.\nThe International of Science\nAt a sitting of the Academy during the War, at the time when national and\npolitical infatuation had reached its height, Emil Fischer spoke the following\nemphatic words: \"It's no use, Gentlemen, science is and remains international.\"\nThe really great scientists have always known this and felt it passionately, even\nthough in times of political confusion they may have remained isolated among\ntheir colleagues of inferior calibre.

    "content": "the Academy during the War, at the time when national and\npolitical infatuation had reached its height, Emil Fischer spoke the following\nemphatic words: \"It's no use, Gentlemen, science is and remains international.\"\nThe really great scientists have always known this and felt it passionately, even\nthough in times of political confusion they may have remained isolated among\ntheir colleagues of inferior calibre. In every camp during the War this mass of\nvoters betrayed their sacred trust. The international society of the academies\nwas broken up. Congresses were and still are held from which colleagues\nfrom ex-enemy countries are excluded. Political considerations, advanced\nwith much solemnity, prevent the triumph of purely objective ways of thinking\nwithout which our great aims must necessarily be frustrated.\nWhat can right-minded people, people who are proof against the emotional\ntemptations of the moment, do to repair the damage? With the majority of\n37\nintellectual workers still so excited, truly international congresses on the grand\nscale cannot yet be held. The psychological obstacles to the restoration of the\ninternational associations of scientific workers are still too formidable to be\novercome by the minority whose ideas and feelings are of a more\ncomprehensive kind. These last can aid in the great work of restoring the\ninternational societies to health by keeping in close touch with like-minded\npeople all over the world and resolutely championing the international cause in\ntheir own spheres. Success on a large scale will take time, but it will\nundoubtedly come. I cannot let this opportunity pass without paying a tribute\nto the way in which the desire to preserve the confraternity of the intellect has\nremained alive through all these difficult years in the breasts of a large number\nof our English colleagues especially.\nThe disposition of the individual is everywhere better than the official\npronouncements. Right-minded people should bear this in mind and not allow\nthemselves to be misled and get angry: senatores boni viri, senatus autem\nbestia.\nIf I am full of confident hope concerning the progress of international\norganization in general, that feeling is based not so much on my confidence in\nthe intelligence and high-mindedness of my fellows, but rather on the\nirresistible pressure of economic developments. And since these depend\nlargely on the work even of reactionary scientists, they too will help to create\nthe international organization against their wills.\nThe Institute for Intellectual Co-operation\nDuring this year the leading politicians of Europe have for the first time drawn\nthe logical conclusion from the truth that our portion of the globe can only\nregain its prosperity if the underground struggle between the traditional\npolitical units ceases. The political organization of Europe must be\nstrengthened, and a gradual attempt made to abolish tariff barriers. This great\nend cannot be achieved by treaties alone. People's minds must, above all, be\nprepared for it. We must try gradually to awaken in them a sense of solidarity\nwhich does not, as hitherto, stop at frontiers. It is with this in mind that the\nLeague of Nations has created the Commission de coopération\nintellectuelle. This Commission is to be an absolutely international and\nentirely nonpolitical authority, whose business it is to put the intellectuals of all\nthe nations, who were isolated by the war, into touch with each other. It is a\ndifficult task; for it has, alas, to be admitted that--at least in the countries with\nwhich I am most closely acquainted--the artists and men of learning are\ngoverned by narrowly nationalist feelings to a far greater extent than the men\nof affairs.\n38\nHitherto this Commission has met twice a year. To make its efforts more\neffective, the French Government has decided to create and maintain a\npermanent Institute for intellectual co-operation, which is just now to be\nopened. It is a generous act on the part of the French nation and deserves the\nthanks of all.\nIt is an easy and grateful task to rejoice and praise and say nothing about the\nthings one regrets or disapproves of. But honesty alone can help our work\nforward, so I will not shrink from combining criticism with this greeting to the\nnew-born child.\nI have daily occasion for observing that the greatest obstacle which the work\nof our Commission has to encounter is the lack of confidence in its political\nimpartiality. Everything must be done to strengthen that confidence and\neverything avoided that might harm it.\nWhen, therefore, the French Government sets up and maintains an Institute\nout of public funds in Paris as a permanent organ of the Commission, with a\nFrenchman as its Director, the outside observer can hardly avoid the\nimpression that French influence predominates in the Commission. This\nimpression is further strengthened by the fact that so far a Frenchman has also\nbeen chairman of the Commission itself. Although the individuals in question\nare men of the highest reputation, liked and respected everywhere,\nnevertheless the impression remains.\nDixi et salvavi animam naeam. I hope with all my heart that the new\nInstitute, by constant interaction with the Commission, will succeed in\npromoting their common ends and winning the confidence and recognition of\nintellectual workers all over the world.\nA Farewell\nA letter to the German Secretary of the League of Nations\n Dear Herr Dufour-Feronce,\n Your kind letter must not go unanswered, otherwise you may get\n a mistaken notion of my attitude.

The grounds for my resolve to\n go to Geneva no more are as follows: Experience has,\n unhappily, taught me that the Commission, taken as a whole,\n stands for no serious determination to make real progress with\n39\n the task of improving international relations. It looks to me far\n more like an embodiment of the principle ut aliquid fieri\n videatur. The Commission seems to me even worse in this\n respect than the League taken as a whole.\n It is precisely because I desire to work with all my might for the\n establishment of an international arbitrating and regulative\n authority superior to the State, and because I have this object\n so very much at heart, that I feel compelled to leave the\n Commission.\n The Commission has given its blessing to the oppression of the\n cultural minorities in all countries by causing a National\n Commission to be set up in each of them, which is to form the\n only channel of communication between the intellectuals of a\n country and the Commission. It has thereby deliberately\n abandoned its function of giving moral support to the national\n minorities in their struggle against cultural oppression.\n Further, the attitude of the Commission in the matter of\n combating the chauvinistic and militaristic tendencies of\n education in the various countries has been so lukewarm that no\n serious efforts in this fundamentally important sphere can be\n hoped for from it.\n The Commission has invariably failed to give moral support to\n those individuals and associations who have thrown themselves\n without reserve into the business of working for an international\n order and against the military system.\n The Commission has never made any attempt to resist the\n appointment of members whom it knew to stand for tendencies\n the very reverse of those it is bound in duty to foster.\n I will not worry you with any further arguments, since you will\n understand my resolve yell enough from these few hints. It is not\n my business to draw up an indictment, but merely to explain my\n position. If I nourished any hope whatever I should act\n differently--of that you may be sure.\nThe Question of Disarmament\nThe greatest obstacle to the success of the disarmament plan was the fact that\n40\npeople in general left out of account the chief difficulties of the problem. Most\nobjects are gained by gradual steps: for example, the supersession of absolute\nmonarchy by democracy. Here, however, we are concerned with an\nobjective which cannot be reached step by step.\nAs long as the possibility of war remains, nations will insist on being as\nperfectly prepared militarily as they can, in order to emerge triumphant from\nthe next war. It will also be impossible to avoid educating the youth in warlike\ntraditions and cultivating narrow national vanity joined to the glorification of\nthe warlike spirit, as long as people have to be prepared for occasions when\nsuch a spirit will be needed in the citizens for the purpose of war. To arm is to\ngive one's voice and make one's preparations not for peace but for war.\nTherefore people will not disarm step by step; they will disarm at one blow or\nnot at all.\nThe accomplishment of such a far-reaching change in the life of nations\npresupposes a mighty moral effort, a deliberate departure from deeply\ningrained tradition. Anyone who is not prepared to make the fate of his\ncountry in case of a dispute depend entirely on the decisions of an\ninternational court of arbitration, and to enter into a treaty to this effect without\nreserve, is not really resolved to avoid war. It is a case of all or nothing.\nIt is undeniable that previous attempts to ensure peace have failed through\naiming at inadequate compromises.\nDisarmament and security are only to be had in combination. The one\nguarantee of security is an undertaking by all nations to give effect to the\ndecisions of the international authority.\nWe stand, therefore, at the parting of the ways. Whether we find the way of\npeace or continue along the old road of brute force, so unworthy of our\ncivilization, depends on ourselves. On the one side the freedom of the\nindividual and the security of society beckon to us, on the other slavery for the\nindividual and the annihilation of our civilization threaten us. Our fate will be\naccording to our deserts.\nThe Disarmament Conference of 1932\nI\nMay I begin with an article of political faith? It runs as follows: The State is\nmade for man, not man for the State. And in this respect science resembles\nthe State. These are old sayings, coined by men for whom human personality\n41\nwas the highest human good. I should shrink from repeating them, were it not\nthat they are for ever threatening to fall into oblivion, particularly in these days\nof organization and mechanization. I regard it as the chief duty of the State to\nprotect the individual and give him the opportunity to develop into a creative\npersonality.\nThat is to say, the State should be our servant and not we its slaves. The State\ntransgresses this commandment when it compels us by force to engage in\nmilitary and war service, the more so since the object and the effect of this\nslavish service is to kill people belonging to other countries or interfere with\ntheir freedom of development. We are only to make such sacrifices to the\nState as will promote the free development of individual human beings. To any\nAmerican all this may be a platitude, but not to any European. Hence we may\nhope that the fight against war will find strong support among Americans.\nAnd now for the Disarmament Conference. Ought one to laugh, weep",

Hence we may\nhope that the fight against war will find strong support among Americans.\nAnd now for the Disarmament Conference. Ought one to laugh, weep, or\nhope when one thinks of it? Imagine a city inhabited by fiery-tempered,\ndishonest, and quarrelsome citizens. The constant danger to life there is felt as\na serious handicap which makes all healthy development impossible. The\nmagistrate desires to remedy this abominable state of affairs, although all his\ncounsellors and the rest of the citizens insist on continuing to carry a dagger in\ntheir girdles. After years of preparation the magistrate determines to\ncompromise and raises the question, how long and how sharp the dagger is\nallowed to be which anyone may carry in his belt when he goes out. As long\nas the cunning citizens do not suppress knifing by legislation, the courts, and\nthe police, things go on in the old way, of course. A definition of the length\nand sharpness of the permitted dagger will help only the strongest and most\nturbulent and leave the weaker at their mercy. You will all understand the\nmeaning of this parable. It is true that we have a League of Nations and a\nCourt of Arbitration. But the League is not much more than a meeting-hall,\nand the Court has no means of enforcing its decisions. These institutions\nprovide no security for any country in case of an attack on it. If you bear this\nin mind, you will judge the attitude of the French, their refusal to disarm\nwithout security, less harshly than it is usually judged at present.\nUnless we can agree to limit the sovereignty of the individual State by all\nbinding ourselves to take joint action against any country which openly or\nsecretly resists a judgment of the Court of Arbitration, we shall never get out\nof a state of universal anarchy and terror. No sleight of hand can reconcile the\nunlimited sovereignty of the individual country with security against attack.\nWill it need new disasters to induce the countries to undertake to enforce\nevery decision of the recognized international court? The progress of events\nso far scarcely justifies us in hoping for anything better in the near future. But\n42\neveryone who cares for civilization and justice must exert all his strength to\nconvince his fellows of the necessity for laying all countries under an\ninternational obligation of this kind.\nIt will be urged against this notion, not without a certain justification, that it\nover-estimates the efficacy of machinery, and neglects the psychological, or\nrather the moral, factor. Spiritual disarmament, people insist, must precede\nmaterial disarmament. They say further, and truly, that the greatest obstacle to\ninternational order is that monstrously exaggerated spirit of nationalism which\nalso goes by the fair-sounding but misused name of patriotism. During the last\ncentury and a half this idol has acquired an uncanny and exceedingly\npernicious power everywhere.\nTo estimate this objection at its proper worth, one must realize that a\nreciprocal relation exists between external machinery and internal states of\nmind. Not only does the machinery depend on traditional modes of feeling\nand owe its origin and its survival to them, but the existing machinery in its turn\nexercises a powerful influence on national modes of feeling.\nThe present deplorably high development of nationalism everywhere is, in my\nopinion, intimately connected with the institution of compulsory military service\nor, to call it by its less offensive name, national armies. A country which\ndemands military service of its inhabitants is compelled to cultivate a\nnationalistic spirit in them, which provides the psychological foundation of\nmilitary efficiency. Along with this religion it has to hold up its instrument, brute\nforce, to the admiration of the youth in its schools.\nThe introduction of compulsory service is therefore, to my mind, the prime\ncause of the moral collapse of the white race, which seriously threatens not\nmerely the survival of our civilization but our very existence. This curse, along\nwith great social blessings, started with the French Revolution, and before\nlong dragged all the other nations in its train.\nTherefore those who desire to encourage the growth of an international spirit\nand to combat chauvinism must take their stand against compulsory service. Is\nthe severe persecution to which conscientious objectors to military service are\nsubjected to-day a whit less disgraceful to the community than those to which\nthe martyrs of religion were exposed in former centuries? Can you, as the\nKellogg Pact does, condemn war and at the same time leave the individual to\nthe tender mercies of the war machine in each country?\nIf, in view of the Disarmament Conference, we are not to restrict ourselves to\nthe technical problems of organization involved but also to tackle the\n43\npsychological question more directly from educational motives, we must try\non international lines to invent some legal way by which the individual can\nrefuse to serve in the army. Such a regulation would undoubtedly produce a\ngreat moral effect.\nThis is my position in a nutshell: Mere agreements to limit armaments furnish\nno sort of security. Compulsory arbitration must be supported by an executive\nforce, guaranteed by all the participating countries, which is ready to proceed\nagainst the disturber of the peace with economic and military sanctions.\nCompulsory service, as the bulwark of unhealthy nationalism, must be\ncombated; most important of all",

As it is, these hard-won\nachievements in the hands of our generation are like a razor in the hands of a\nchild of three. The possession of marvellous means of production has brought\ncare and hunger instead of freedom.\nThe results of technical progress are most baleful where they furnish means for\nthe destruction of human life and the hard-won fruits of toil, as we of the older\ngeneration experienced to our horror in the Great War. More dreadful even\nthan the destruction, in my opinion, is the humiliating slavery into which war\nplunges the individual. Is it not a terrible thing to be forced by the community\nto do things which every individual regards as abominable crimes? Only a few\nhad the moral greatness to resist; them I regard as the real heroes of the Great\nWar.\nThere is one ray of hope. I believe that the responsible leaders of the nations\ndo, in the main, honestly desire to abolish war. The resistance to this essential\nstep forward comes from those unfortunate national traditions which are\nhanded on like a hereditary disease from generation to generation through the\nworkings of the educational system. The principal vehicle of this tradition is\nmilitary training and its glorification, and, equally, that portion of the Press\nwhich is controlled by heavy industry and the soldiers. Without disarmament\n44\nthere can be no lasting peace. Conversely, the continuation of military\npreparations on the present scale will inevitably lead to new catastrophes.\nThat is why the Disarmament Conference of 1932 will decide the fate of this\ngeneration and the next. When one thinks how pitiable, taken as a whole,\nhave been the results of former conferences, it becomes clear that it is the\nduty of all intelligent and responsible people to exert their full powers to\nremind public opinion again and again of the importance of the 1932\nConference. Only if the statesmen have behind them the will to peace of a\ndecisive majority in their own countries can they attain their great end, and for\nthe formation of this public opinion each one of us is responsible in every\nword and deed.\nThe doom of the Conference would be sealed if the delegates came to it with\nready-made instructions, the carrying out of which would soon become a\nmatter of prestige. This seems to be generally realized. For meetings between\nthe statesmen of two nations at a time, which have become very frequent of\nlate, have been used to prepare the ground for the Conference by\nconversations about the disarmament problem. This seems to me a very\nhappy device, for two men or groups of men can usually discuss things\ntogether most reasonably, honestly, and dispassionately when there is no third\nperson present in front of whom they think they must be careful what they say.\nOnly if exhaustive preparations of this kind are made for the Conference, if\nsurprises are thereby ruled out, and an atmosphere of confidence is created\nby genuine good will, can we hope for a happy issue.\nIn these great matters success is not a matter of cleverness, still less of\ncunning, but of honesty and confidence. The moral element cannot be\ndisplaced by reason, thank heaven ! It is not the individual spectator's duty\nmerely to wait and criticize. He must serve the cause by all means in his\npower. The fate of the world will be such as the world deserves.\nAmerica and the Disarmasnent Conference\nThe Americans of to-day are filled with the cares arising out of economic\nconditions in their own country. The efforts of their responsible leaders are\ndirected primarily to remedying the serious unemployment at home. The sense\nof being involved in the destiny of the rest of the world, and in particular of the\nmother country of Europe, is even less strong than in normal times.\nBut the free play of economic forces will not by itself automatically overcome\nthese difficulties. Regulative measures by the community are needed to bring\nabout a sound distribution of labour and consumption-goods among mankind;\n45\nwithout them even the people of the richest country suffocate. The fact is that\nsince the amount of work needed to supply everybody's needs has been\nreduced through the improvement of technical methods, the free play of\neconomic forces no longer produces a state of affairs in which all the available\nlabour can find employment. Deliberate regulation and organization are\nbecoming necessary to make the results of technical progress beneficial to all.\nIf the economic situation cannot be cleared up without systematic regulation,\nhow much more necessary is such regulation for dealing with the problems of\ninternational politics! Few people still cling to the notion that acts of violence\nin the shape of wars are either advantageous or worthy of humanity as a\nmethod of solving international problems. But they are not logical",

Few people still cling to the notion that acts of violence\nin the shape of wars are either advantageous or worthy of humanity as a\nmethod of solving international problems. But they are not logical enough to\nmake vigorous efforts on behalf of the measures which might prevent war, that\nsavage and unworthy relic of the age of barbarism. It requires some power of\nreflection to see the issue clearly and a certain courage to serve this great\ncause resolutely and effectively.\nAnybody who really wants to abolish war must resolutely declare himself in\nfavour of his own country's resigning a portion of its sovereignty in favour of\ninternational institutions: he must be ready to make his own country amenable,\nin case of a dispute, to the award of an international court. He must in the\nmost uncompromising fashion support disarmament all round, which is actually\nenvisaged in the unfortunate Treaty of Versailles; unless military and\naggressively patriotic education is abolished, we can hope for no progress.\nNo event of the last few years reflects such disgrace on the leading civilized\ncountries of the world as the failure of all disarmament conferences so far; for\nthis failure is due not only to the intrigues of ambitious and unscrupulous\npoliticians, but also to the indifference and slackness of the public in all\ncountries. Unless this is changed we shall destroy all the really valuable\nachievements of our predecessors.\nI believe that the American nation is only imperfectly aware of the\nresponsibility which rests with it in this matter. People in America no doubt\nthink as follows: \"Let Europe go to the dogs, if it is destroyed by the\nquarrelsomeness and wickedness of its inhabitants. The good seed of our\nWilson has produced a mighty poor crop in the stony ground of Europe. We\nare strong and safe and in no hurry to mix ourselves up in other people's\naffairs.\"\nSuch an attitude is at once base and shortsighted. America is partly to blame\nfor the difficulties of Europe. By ruthlessly pressing her claims she is hastening\nthe economic and therewith the moral collapse of Europe; she has helped to\n46\nBalkanize Europe, and therefore shares the responsibility for the breakdown\nof political morality and the growth of that spirit of revenge which feeds on\ndespair. This spirit will not stop short of the gates of America--I had almost\nsaid, has not stopped short. Look around, and look forward.\nThe truth can be briefly stated: The Disarmament Conference comes as a final\nchance, to you no less than to us, of preserving the best that civilized humanity\nhas produced. And it is on you, as the strongest and comparatively soundest\namong us, that the eyes and hopes of all are focused.\nActive Pacifism\nI consider myself lucky in witnessing the great peace demonstration organized\nby the Flemish people. To all concerned in it I feel impelled to call out in the\nname of men of good will with a care for the future: \"In this hour of opened\neyes and awakening conscience we feel ourselves united with you by the\ndeepest ties.\"\nWe must not conceal from ourselves that an improvement in the present\ndepressing situation is impossible without a severe struggle; for the handful of\nthose who are really determined to do something is minute in comparison with\nthe mass of the lukewarm and the misguided. And those who have an interest\nin keeping the machinery of war going are a very powerful body; they will\nstop at nothing to make public opinion subservient to their murderous ends.\nIt looks as if the ruling statesmen of to-day were really trying to secure\npermanent peace. But the ceaseless piling-up of armaments shows only too\nclearly that they are unequal to coping with the hostile forces which are\npreparing for war. In my opinion, deliverance can only come from the peoples\nthemselves. If they wish to avoid the degrading slavery of war-service, they\nmust declare with no uncertain voice for complete disarmament. As long as\narmies exist, any serious quarrel will lead to war. A pacifism which does not\nactually try to prevent the nations from arming is and must remain impotent.\nMay the conscience and the common sense of the peoples be awakened, so\nthat we may reach a new stage in the life of nations, where people will look\nback on war as an incomprehensible aberration of their forefathers!\nLetter to a Friend of Peace\nIt has come to my ears that in your greatheartedness you are quietly\naccomplishing a splendid work, impelled by solicitude for humanity and its\nfate. Small is the number of them that see with their own eyes and feel with\n47\ntheir own hearts. But it is their strength that will decide whether the human\nrace must relapse into that hopeless condition which a blind multitude appears\nto-day to regard as the ideal.\nO that the nations might see, before it is too late, how much of their\nself-determination they have got to sacrifice in order to avoid the struggle of\nall against all! The power of conscience and the international spirit has proved\nitself inadequate. At present it is being so weak as to tolerate parleying with\nthe worst enemies of civilization. There is a kind of conciliation which is a\ncrime against humanity, and it passes for political wisdom.\nWe cannot despair of humanity, since we are ourselves human",

The power of conscience and the international spirit has proved\nitself inadequate. At present it is being so weak as to tolerate parleying with\nthe worst enemies of civilization. There is a kind of conciliation which is a\ncrime against humanity, and it passes for political wisdom.\nWe cannot despair of humanity, since we are ourselves human beings. And it\nis a comfort that there still exist individuals like yourself, whom one knows to\nbe alive and undismayed.\nAnother ditto\n Dear friend and spiritual brother,\n To be quite frank, a declaration like the one before me in a\n country which submits to conscription in peace-time seems to\n me valueless. What you must fight for is liberation from universal\n military service. Verily the French nation has had to pay heavily\n for the victory of 1918; for that victory has been largely\n responsible for holding it down in the most degrading of all forms\n of slavery. Let your efforts in this struggle be unceasing. You\n have a mighty ally in the German reactionaries and militarists. If\n France clings to universal military service, it will be impossible in\n the long run to prevent its introduction into Germany. For the\n demand of the Germans for equal rights will succeed in the end;\n and then there will be two German military slaves to every\n French one, which would certainly not be in the interests of\n France.\n Only if we succeed in abolishing compulsory service altogether\n will it be possible to educate the youth in the spirit of\n reconciliation, joy in life, and love towards all living creatures.\n I believe that a refusal on conscientious grounds to serve in the\n army when called up, if carried out by 50,000 men at the same\n moment, would be irresistible. The individual can accomplish\n little here, nor can one wish to see the best among us devoted to\n destruction through the machinery behind which stand the three\n48\n great powers of stupidity, fear, and greed.\nA third ditto\n Dear Sir,\n The point with which you deal in your letter is one of prime\n importance. The armament industry is, as you say, one of the\n greatest dangers that beset mankind. It is the hidden evil power\n behind the nationalism which is rampant everywhere.&hellip;\n Possibly something might be gained by nationalization. But it is\n extremely hard to determine exactly what industries should be\n included. Should the aircraft industry? And how much of the\n metal industry and the chemical industry?\n As regards the munitions industry and the export of war material,\n the League of Nations has busied itself for years with efforts to\n get this horrible traffic controlled--with what little success, we all\n know. Last year I asked a well-known American diplomat why\n Japan was not forced by a commercial boycott to desist from\n her policy of force. \"Our commercial interests are too strong,\"\n was the answer. How can one help people who rest satisfied\n with a statement like that?\n You believe that a word from me would suffice to get something\n done in this sphere? What an illusion! People flatter me as long\n as I do not get in their way. But if I direct my efforts towards\n objects which do not suit them, they immediately turn to abuse\n and calumny in defence of their interests. And the onlookers\n mostly keep out of the light, the cowards! Have you ever tested\n the civil courage of your countrymen? The silently accepted\n motto is \"Leave it alone and don't speak of it.\" You may be sure\n that I shall do everything in my power along the lines you\n indicate, but nothing can be achieved as directly as you think.\nWomen and War\nIn my opinion, the patriotic women ought to be sent to the front in the next\nwar instead of the men. It would at least be a novelty in this dreary sphere of\ninfinite confusion, and besides--why should not such heroic feelings on the\npart of the fair sex find a more picturesque outlet than in attacks on a\ndefenceless civilian?\n49\nThoughts on the World Economic Crisis\nIf there is one thing that can give a layman in the sphere of economics the\ncourage to express an opinion on the nature of the alarming economic\ndifficulties of the present day, it is the hopeless confusion of opinions among\nthe experts. What I have to say is nothing new and does not pretend to be\nanything more than the opinion of an independent and honest man who,\nunburdened by class or national prejudices, desires nothing but the good of\nhumanity and the most harmonious possible scheme of human existence. If in\nwhat follows I write as if I were clear about certain things and sure of the truth\nof what I am saying, this is done merely for the sake of an easier mode of\nexpression; it does not proceed from unwarranted self-confidence or a belief\nin the infallibility of my somewhat simple intellectual conception of problems\nwhich are in reality uncommonly complex.\nAs I see it, this crisis differs in character from past crises in that it is based on\nan entirely new set of conditions, due to rapid progress in methods of\nproduction. Only a fraction of the available human labour in the world is\nneeded for the production of the total amount of consumption-goods\nnecessary to life. Under a completely free economic system this fact is bound\nto lead to unemployment. For reasons which I do not propose to analyse\nhere, the majority of people are compelled to work for the minimum wage on\nwhich life can be supported.

Under a completely free economic system this fact is bound\nto lead to unemployment. For reasons which I do not propose to analyse\nhere, the majority of people are compelled to work for the minimum wage on\nwhich life can be supported. If two factories produce the same sort of goods,\nother things being equal, that one will be able to produce them more cheaply\nwhich employs less workmen--i.e., makes the individual worker work as long\nand as hard as human nature permits. From this it follows inevitably that, with\nmethods of production what they are to-day, only a portion of the available\nlabour can be used. While unreasonable demands are made on this portion,\nthe remainder is automatically excluded from the process of production. This\nleads to a fall in sales and profits. Businesses go smash, which further\nincreases unemployment and diminishes confidence in industrial concerns and\ntherewith public participation in these mediating banks; finally the banks\nbecome insolvent through the sudden withdrawal of deposits and the wheels\nof industry therewith come to a complete standstill.\nThe crisis has also been attributed to other causes which we will now\nconsider.\n(1) Over-production. We have to distinguish between two things here--real\nover-production and apparent over-production. By real overproduction I\nmean a production so great that it exceeds the demand. This m4y perhaps\napply to motor-cars and wheat in the United States at the present moment,\n50\nalthough even that is doubtful. By \"over-production\" people usually mean a\ncondition of things in which more of one particular article is produced than\ncan, in existing circumstances, be sold, in spite of a shortage of\nconsumption-goods among consumers. This condition of things I call apparent\nover-production. In this case it is not the demand that is lacking but the\nconsumers' purchasing-power. Such apparent over-production is only another\nword for a crisis, and therefore cannot serve as an explanation of the latter;\nhence people who try to make over-production responsible for the crisis are\nmerely juggling with words.\n(2) Reparations. The obligation to pay reparations lies heavy on the debtor\nnations and their industries, compels them to go in for dumping, and so harms\nthe creditor nations too This is beyond dispute. But the appearance of the\ncrisis in the United States, in spite of the high tariff-wall protecting them,\nproves that this cannot be the principal cause of the world crisis. The shortage\nof gold in the debtor countries due to reparations can at most serve as an\nargument for putting an end to these payments; it cannot be dragged in as an\nexplanation of the world crisis.\n(3) Erection of near tariff-walls. Increase in the unproductive burden of\narmaments. Political in security owing to latent danger of war. All these things\nadd considerably to the troubles of Europe, but do not materially affect\nAmerica. The appearance of the crisis in America shows that they cannot be\nits principal causes.\n(4) The dropping-out of the two Powers, China and Russia. This blow to\nworld trade also does not touch America very nearly, and therefore cannot be\na principal cause of the crisis.\n(5) The economic rise of the lower classes since the War. This, supposing\nit to be a reality, could only produce a scarcity of goods, not an excessive\nsupply.\nI will not weary the reader by enumerating further contentions which do not\nseem to me to get to the heart of the matter. Of one thing I feel certain: this\nsame technical progress which, in itself, might relieve mankind of a great part\nof the labour necessary to its subsistence, is the main cause of our present\ntroubles. Hence there are those who would in all seriousness forbid the\nintroduction of technical improvements. This is obviously absurd. But how can\nwe find a more rational way out of our dilemma?\nIf we could somehow manage to prevent the purchasing-power of the\nmasses, measured in terms of goods, from sinking below a certain minimum,\n51\nstoppages in the industrial cycle such as we are experiencing to-day would be\nrendered impossible.\nThe logically simplest but also most daring method of achieving this is a\ncompletely planned economy, in which consumption-goods are produced and\ndistributed by the community. That, in essentials, is what is being attempted in\nRussia to-day. Much will depend on what results this mighty experiment\nproduces. To hazard a prophecy here would be presumption. Can goods be\nproduced as economically under such a system as under one which leaves\nmore freedom to individual enterprise? Can this system maintain itself at all\nwithout the terror that has so far accompanied it, which none of us\n\"westerners\" would care to let himself in for? Does not such a rigid,\ncentralized system tend towards protection and hostility to advantageous\ninnovations? We must take care, however, not to allow these suspicions to\nbecome prejudices which prevent us from forming an objective judgment.\nMy personal opinion is that those methods are preferable which respect\nexisting traditions and habits so far as that is in any way compatible with the\nend in view. Nor do I believe that a sudden transference of the control of\nindustry to the hands of the public would be beneficial from the point of view\nof production; private enterprise should be left its sphere of activity, in so far\nas it has not already been eliminated by industry itself in the form of\ncartelization.\nThere are, however, two respects in which this economic freedom ought to be\nlimited.

In each branch of industry the number of working hours per week\nought so to be reduced by law that unemployment is systematically abolished.\nAt the same time minimum wages must be fixed in such a way that the\npurchasing power of the workers keeps pace with production.\nFurther, in those industries which have become monopolistic in character\nthrough organization on the part of the producers, prices must be controlled\nby the State in order to keep the creation of new capital within reasonable\nbounds and prevent the artificial strangling of production and consumption.\nIn this way it might perhaps be possible to establish a proper balance between\nproduction and consumption without too great a limitation of free enterprise,\nand at the same time to stop the intolerable tyranny of the owners of the\nmeans of production (land, machinery) over the wage-earners, in the widest\nsense of the term.\nCulture and Prosperity\n52\nIf one would estimate the damage done by the great political catastrophe to\nthe development of human civilization, one must remember that culture in its\nhigher forms is a delicate plant which depends on a complicated set of\nconditions and is wont to flourish only in a few places at any given time. For it\nto blossom there is needed, first of all, a certain degree of prosperity, which\nenables a fraction of the population to work at things not directly necessary to\nthe maintenance of life; secondly, a moral tradition of respect for cultural\nvalues and achievements, in virtue of which this class is provided with the\nmeans of living by the other classes, those who provide the immediate\nnecessities of life.\nDuring the past century Germany has been one of the countries in which both\nconditions were fulfilled. The prosperity was, taken as a whole, modest but\nsufficient; the tradition of respect for culture vigorous. On this basis the\nGerman nation has brought forth fruits of culture which form an integral part of\nthe development of the modern world. The tradition, in the main, still stands;\nthe prosperity is gone. The industries of the country have been cut off almost\ncompletely from the sources of raw materials on which the existence of the\nindustrial part of the population was based. The surplus necessary to support\nthe intellectual worker has suddenly ceased to exist. With it the tradition which\ndepends on it will inevitably collapse also, and a fruitful nursery of culture turn\nto wilderness.\nThe human race, in so far as it sets a value on culture, has an interest in\npreventing such impoverishment. It will give what help it can in the immediate\ncrisis and reawaken that higher community of feeling, now thrust into the\nbackground by national egotism, for which human values have a validity\nindependent of politics and frontiers. It will then procure for every nation\nconditions of work under which it can exist and under which it can bring forth\nfruits of culture.\nProduction and Purchasing Power\nI do not believe that the remedy for our present difficulties lies in a knowledge\nof productive capacity and consumption, because this knowledge is likely, in\nthe main, to come too late. Moreover the trouble in Germany seems to me to\nbe not hypertrophy of the machinery of production but deficient purchasing\npower in a large section of the population, which has been cast out of the\nproductive process through rationalization.\nThe gold standard has, in my opinion, the serious disadvantage that a shortage\nin the supply of gold automatically leads to a contraction of credit and also of\n53\nthe amount of currency in circulation, to which contraction prices and wages\ncannot adjust themselves sufficiently quickly. The natural remedies for our\ntroubles are, in my opinion, as follows:--\n(1) A statutory reduction of working hours, graduated for each department of\nindustry, in order to get rid of unemployment, combined with the fixing of\nminimum wages for the purpose of adjusting the purchasing-power of the\nmasses to the amount of goods available.\n(2) Control of the amount of money in circulation and of the volume of credit\nin such a way as to keep the price-level steady, all special protection being\nabolished.\n(3) Statutory limitation of prices for such articles as have been practically\nwithdrawn from free competition by monopolies or the formation of cartels.\nProduction and Work\nAn answer to Cederström\n Dear Herr Cederström,\n Thank you for sending me your proposals, which interest me\n very much. Having myself given so much thought to this subject I\n feel that it is right that I should give you my perfectly frank\n opinion on them.\n The fundamental trouble seems to me to be the almost unlimited\n freedom of the labour market combined with extraordinary\n progress in the methods of production. To satisfy the needs of\n the world to-day nothing like all the available labour is wanted.\n The result is unemployment and excessive competition among\n the workers, both of which reduce purchasing power and put\n the whole economic system intolerably out of gear.\n I know Liberal economists maintain that every economy in\n labour is counterbalanced by an increase in demand. But, to\n begin with, I don't believe it, and even if it were true, the\n above-mentioned factors would always operate to force the\n standard of living of a large portion of the human race doom to\n an unnaturally low level.\n I also share your conviction that steps absolutely must be taken\n54\n to make it",

Further, that the older people\n ought to be excluded from certain sorts of work (which I call\n \"unqualified\" work), receiving instead a certain income, as having\n by that time done enough work of a kind accepted by society as\n productive.\n I too am in favour of abolishing large cities, but not of settling\n people of a particular type--e.g., old people--in particular\n towns. Frankly, the idea strikes me as horrible. I am also of\n opinion that fluctuations in the value of money must be avoided,\n by substituting for the gold standard a standard based on certain\n classes of goods selected according to the conditions of\n consumption--as Keynes, if I am not mistaken, long ago\n proposed. With the introduction of this system one might\n consent to a certain amount of \"inflation,\" as compared with the\n present monetary situation, if one could believe that the State\n would really make a rational use of the windfall thus accruing to\n it.\n The weaknesses of your plan lie, so it seems to me, in the sphere\n of psychology, or rather, in your neglect of it. It is no accident\n that capitalism has brought with it progress not merely in\n production but also in knowledge. Egoism and competition are,\n alas, stronger forces than public spirit and sense of duty. In\n Russia, they say, it is impossible to get a decent piece of\n bread.&hellip;Perhaps I am over-pessimistic concerning State\n and other forms of communal enterprise, but I expect little good\n from them. Bureaucracy is the death of all sound work. I have\n seen and experienced too many dreadful warnings, even in\n comparatively model Switzerland.\n I am inclined to the view that the State can only be of real use to\n industry as a limiting and regulative force. It must see to it that\n competition among the workers is kept within healthy limits, that\n all children are given a chance to develop soundly, and that\n wages are high enough for the goods produced to be consumed.\n But it can exert a decisive influence through its regulative function\n if--and there again you are right--its measures are framed in an\n objective spirit by independent experts.\n I would like to write to you at greater length, but cannot find the\n time.\n55\nMinorities\nIt seems to be a universal fact that minorities--especially when the individuals\ncomposing them are distinguished by physical peculiarities--are treated by the\nmajorities among whom they live as an inferior order of beings. The tragedy of\nsuch a fate lies not merely in the unfair treatment to which these minorities are\nautomatically subjected in social and economic matters, but also in the fact\nthat under the suggestive influence of the majority most of the victims\nthemselves succumb to the same prejudice and regard their brethren as\ninferior beings. This second and greater part of the evil can be overcome by\ncloser combination and by deliberate education of the minority, whose\nspiritual liberation can thus be accomplished.\nThe efforts of the American negroes in this direction are deserving of all\ncommendation and assistance.\nObservations on the Present Situation in Europe\nThe distinguishing feature of the present political situation of the world, and in\nparticular of Europe, seems to me to be this, that political. development has\nfailed, both materially and intellectually, to keep pace with economic\nnecessity, which has changed its character in a comparatively short time. The\ninterests of each country must be subordinated to the interests of the wider\ncommunity. The struggle for this new orientation of political thought and\nfeeling is a severe one, because it has the tradition of centuries against it. But\nthe survival of Europe depends on its successful issue. It is my firm conviction\nthat once the psychological impediments are overcome the solution of the real\nproblems will not be such a terribly difficult matter. In order to create the right\natmosphere, the most essential thing is personal co-operation between men of\nlike mind. May our united efforts succeed in building a bridge of mutual trust\nbetween the nations!\nThe Heirs of the Ages\nPrevious generations were able to look upon intellectual and cultural progress\nas simply the inherited fruits of their forebears' labours, which made life easier\nand more beautiful for them. But the calamities of our times show us that this\nwas a fatal illusion.\nWe see now that the greatest efforts are needed if this legacy of humanity's is\nto prove a blessing and not a curse. For whereas formerly it was enough for a\n56\nman to have freed himself to some extent from personal egotism to make him\na valuable member of society, to-day he must also be required to overcome\nnational and class egotism. Only if he reaches those heights can he contribute\ntowards improving the lot of humanity.\nAs regards this most important need of the age the inhabitants of a small State\nare better placed than those of a great Power, since the latter are exposed,\nboth in politics and economics, to the temptation to gain their ends by brute\nforce. The agreement between Holland and Belgium, which is the only bright\nspot in European affairs during the last few years, encourages one to hope\nthat the small",

The version published in German\nnewspapers was for the most part incorrect, important sentences being\n57\nomitted.\nThe Academy's declaration of April I, 1933, against Einstein.\nThe Prussian Academy of Sciences heard with indignation from the\nnewspapers of Albert Einstein's participation in atrocity-mongering in France\nand America. It immediately demanded an explanation. In the meantime\nEinstein has announced his withdrawal from the Academy, giving as his reason\nthat he cannot continue to serve the Prussian State under its present\nGovernment. Being a Swiss citizen, he also, it seems, intends to resign the\nPrussian nationality which he acquired in 1913 simply by becoming a full\nmember of the Academy.\nThe Prussian Academy of Sciences is particularly distressed by Einstein's\nactivities as an agitator in foreign countries, as it and its members have always\nfelt themselves bound by the closest ties to the Prussian State and, while\nabstaining strictly from all political partisanship, have alwa58 stressed and\nremained faithful to the national idea. It has, therefore, no reason to regret\nEinstein's withdrawal.\nProf. Dr. Ernst Heymann,\nPerpetual Secretary.\nLe Coq, near Ostende, April 5, 1933\n To the Prussian Academy of Sciences,\n I have received information from a thoroughly reliable source\n that the Academy of Sciences has spoken in an official statement\n of \"Einstein's participation in atrocity-mongering in America and\n France.\"\n I hereby declare that I have never taken any part in\n atrocity-mongering, and I must add that I have seen nothing of\n any such mongering anywhere. In general people have contented\n themselves with reproducing and commenting on the official\n statements and orders of responsible members of the German\n Government, together with the programme for the annihilation of\n the German Jews by economic methods.\n The statements I have issued to the Press were concerned with\n my intention to resign my position in the Academy and renounce\n my Prussian citizenship; I gave as my reason for these steps that\n I did not wish to live in a country where the individual does not\n58\n enjoy equality before the law and freedom to say and teach what\n he likes.\n Further, I described the present state of affairs in Germany as a\n state of psychic distemper in the masses and also made some\n remarks about its causes.\n In a written document which I allowed the International League\n for combating Anti-Semitism to make use of for the purpose of\n enlisting support, and which was not intended for the Press at all,\n I also called upon all sensible people, who are still faithful to the\n ideals of a civilization in peril, to do their utmost to prevent this\n mass-psychosis, which is exhibiting itself in such terrible\n symptoms in Germany to-day, from spreading further.\n It would have been an easy matter for the Academy to get hold\n of a correct version of my words before issuing the sort of\n statement about me that it has. The German Press has\n reproduced a deliberately distorted version of my words, as\n indeed was only to be expected with the Press muzzled as it is\n to-day.\n I am ready to stand by every word I have published. In return, I\n expect the Academy to communicate this statement of mine to\n its members and also to the German public before which I have\n been slandered, especially as it has itself had a hand in slandering\n me before that public.\nThe Academy's Answer of April 11, 1933\n The Academy would like to point out that its statement of April\n 1, 1933. was based not merely on German but principally on\n foreign, particularly French and Belgian, newspaper reports\n which Herr Einstein has not contradicted; in addition, it had\n before it his much-canvassed statement to the League for\n combating anti-Semitism, in which he deplores Germany's\n relapse into the barbarism of",

The Academy took cognizance of your\n resignation in its plenary session of March 30, 1933.\n While the Academy profoundly regrets the turn events have\n taken, this regret is inspired by the thought that a man of the\n highest scientific authority, whom many years of work among\n Germans and many years of membership of our society must\n have made familiar with the German character and German\n habits of thought, should have chosen this moment to associate\n himself with a body of people abroad who--partly no doubt\n through ignorance of actual conditions and events--have done\n much damage to our German people by disseminating erroneous\n views and unfounded rumours. We had confidently expected\n that one who had belonged to our Academy for so long would\n have ranged himself, irrespective of his own political sympathies,\n on the side of the defenders of our nation against the flood of lies\n which has been let loose upon it. In these days of mud-slinging,\n some of it vile, some of it ridiculous, a good word for the\n German people from you in particular might have produced a\n great effect, especially abroad. Instead of which your testimony\n has served as a handle to the enemies not merely of the present\n Government but of the German people. This has come as a\n bitter and grievous disappointment to us, which would no doubt\n have led inevitably to a parting of the ways even if we had not\n60\n received your resignation.\n Yours faithfully,\n (signed) von Ficker.\nLe Coq-sur-Mer, Belgium, April 12, 1933\nTo the Prussian Academy of Sciences, Berlin.\n I have received your communication of the seventh instant and\n deeply deplore the mental attitude displayed in it.\n As regards the fact, I can only reply as follows: What you say\n about my behaviour is, at bottom, merely another form of the\n statement you have already published, in which you accuse me\n of having taken part in atrocity-mongering against the German\n nation. I have already, in my last letter, characterized this\n accusation as slanderous.\n You have also remarked that a \"good word\" on my part for \"the\n German people\" would have produced a great effect abroad. To\n this I must reply that such a testimony as you suggest would have\n been equivalent to a repudiation of all those notions of justice\n and liberty for which I have all my life stood. Such a testimony\n would not be, as you put it, a good word for the German nation;\n on the contrary, it would only have helped the cause of those\n who are seeking to undermine the ideas and principles which\n have won for the German nation a place of honour in the\n civilized world. By giving such a testimony in the present\n circumstances I should have been contributing, even if only\n indirectly, to the barbarization of manners and the destruction of\n all existing cultural values.\n It was for this reason that I felt compelled to resign from the\n Academy, and your letter only shows me how right I was to do\n so.\nMunich, Aril 8, 1933\nFrom the Bavarian Academy of Sciences to Professor Albert Einstein.\n Sir,\n61\n In your letter to the Prussian Academy of Sciences you have\n given the present state of affairs in Germany as the reason for\n your resignation.

    "content": "what has passed between yourself and the\n Prussian Academy.\n The President of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences.\n Le Coq-sur-Mer, April 21, 1933\nTo the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, Munich.\n I have given it as the reason for my resignation from the Prussian\n Academy that in the present circumstances I have no wish either\n to be a German citizen or to remain in a position of\n quasi-dependence on the Prussian Ministry of Education.\n These reasons would not, in themselves, involve the severing of\n my relations with the Bavarian Academy. If I nevertheless desire\n my name to be removed from the list of members, it is for a\n different reason.\n The primary duty of an Academy is to encourage and protect\n the scientific life of a country. The learned societies of Germany\n have, however--to the best of knowledge--stood by and said\n nothing while a not inconsiderable proportion of German savants\n and students, and also of professional men of university\n education, have been deprived of all chance of getting\n employment or earning their livings in Germany. I would rather\n not belong to any society which behaves in such a manner, even\n if it does so under external pressure.\nA Reply\nThe following lines are Einstein's answer to an invitation to associate\nhimself with a French manifesto against Anti-Semitism in Germany.\n62\nI have considered this most important proposal, which has a bearing on\nseveral things that I have nearly at heart, carefully from every angle. As a\nresult I have come to the conclusion that I cannot take a personal part in this\nextremely important affair, for two reasons:--\nIn the first place I am, after all, still a German citizen, and in the second I am a\nJew. As regards the first point I must add that I have worked in German\ninstitutions and have always been treated with full confidence in Germany.\nHowever deeply I may regret the things that are being done there, however\nstrongly I am bound to condemn the terrible mistakes that are being made\nwith the approval of the Government; it is impossible for me to take part\npersonally in an enterprise set on foot by responsible members of a foreign\nGovernment. In order that you may appreciate this fully, suppose that a\nFrench citizen in a more or less analogous situation had got up a protest\nagainst the French Government's action in conjunction with prominent German\nstatesmen. Even if you fully admitted that the protest was amply warranted by\nthe facts, you would still, I expect, regard the behaviour of your fellow-citizen\nas an act of treachery. If Zola had felt it necessary to leave France at the time\nof the Dreyfus case, he would still certainly not have associated himself with a\nprotest by German official personages, however much he might have\napproved of their action. He would have confined himself to--blushing for his\ncountrymen. In the second place, a protest against injustice and violence is\nincomparably more valuable if it comes entirely from people who have been\nprompted to it purely by sentiments of humanity and a love of Pew This\ncannot be said of a man like me, a few who regards other Jews as his\nbrothers. For him, an injustice done to the Jews is the same as an injustice\ndone to himself. He must not be the judge in his own case, but wait for the\njudgment of impartial outsiders.\nThese are my reasons. But I should like to add that I have always honoured\nand admired that highly developed sense of justice which is one of the noblest\nfeatures of the French tradition.\nIV\n The Jews\nJewish Ideals\nThe pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, an almost fanatical love of justice,\nand the desire for personal independence--these are the features of the Jewish\ntradition which make me thank my stars that I belong to it.\n63\nThose who are raging to-day against the ideals of reason and individual liberty\nand are trying to establish a spiritless State-slavery by brute force rightly see\nin us their irreconcilable foes. History has given us a difficult row to hoe; but\nso long as we remain devoted servants of truth, justice, and liberty, we shall\ncontinue not merely to survive as the oldest of living peoples, but by creative\nwork to bring forth fruits which contribute to the ennoblement of the human\nrace, as heretofore.\nIs there a Jewish Point of View?\nIn the philosophical sense there is, in my opinion, no specifically Jewish\noutlook. Judaism seems to me to be concerned almost exclusively with the\nmoral attitude in life and to life. I look upon it as the essence of an attitude to\nlife which is incarnate in the Jewish people rather than the essence of the laws\nlaid down in the Thora and interpreted in the Talmud. To me, the Thora and\nthe Talmud are merely the most important evidence for the manner in which\nthe Jewish conception of life held sway in earlier times.\nThe essence of that conception seems to me to lie in an affirmative attitude to\nthe life of all creation. The life of the individual has meaning only in so far as it\naids in making the life of every living thing nobler and more beautiful. Life is\nsacred--that is to say, it is the supreme value, to which all other values are\nsubordinate. The hallowing of the supra-individual life brings in its train a\nreverence for everything spiritual--a particularly characteristic feature of the\nJewish tradition.\nJudaism is not a creed: the Jewish God is simply a negation of superstition, an\nimaginary result of its elimination. It is also an attempt",

The hallowing of the supra-individual life brings in its train a\nreverence for everything spiritual--a particularly characteristic feature of the\nJewish tradition.\nJudaism is not a creed: the Jewish God is simply a negation of superstition, an\nimaginary result of its elimination. It is also an attempt to base the moral law\non fear, a regrettable and discreditable attempt. Yet it seems to me that the\nstrong moral tradition of the Jewish nation has to a large extent shaken itself\nfree from this fear. It is clear also that \"serving God\" was equated with\n\"serving the living.\" The best of the Jewish people, especially the Prophets and\nJesus, contended tirelessly for this.\nJudaism is thus no transcendental religion; it is concerned with life as we live it\nand can up to a point grasp it, and nothing else. It seems to me, therefore,\ndoubtful whether it can be called a religion in the accepted sense of the word,\nparticularly as no \"faith\" but the sanctification of life in a supra-personal sense\nis demanded of the Jew.\nBut the Jewish tradition also contains something else, something which finds\nsplendid expression in many of the Psalms--namely, a sort of intoxicated joy\n64\nand amazement at the beauty and grandeur of this world, of which, man can\njust form a faint notion. It is the feeling from which true scientific research\ndraws its spiritual sustenance, but which also seems to find expression in the\nsong of birds. To tack this on to the idea of God seems mere childish\nabsurdity.\nIs what I have described a distinguishing mark of Judaism? Is it to be found\nanywhere else under another name? In its pure form, nowhere, not even in\nJudaism, where the pure doctrine is obscured by much worship of the letter.\nYet Judaism seems to me one of its purest and most vigorous manifestations.\nThis applies particularly to the fundamental principle of the sanctification of\nlife.\nIt is characteristic that the animals were expressly included in the command to\nkeep holy the Sabbath day, so strong was the feeling that the ideal demands\nthe solidarity of all living things. The insistence on the solidarity of all human\nbeings finds still stronger expression, apd it is no mere chance that the\ndemands of Socialism were for the most part first raised by Jews.\nHow strongly developed this sense of the sanctity of life is in the Jewish\npeople is admirably illustrated by a little remark which Walter Rathenau once\nmade to me in conversation: \"When a Jew says that he's going hunting to\namuse himself, he lies.\" The Jewish sense of the sanctity of life could not be\nmore simply expressed.\nJewish Youth\nAn Answer to a Questionnaire\nIt is important that the young should be induced to take an interest in Jewish\nquestions and difficulties, and you deserve gratitude for devoting yourself to\nthis task in your paper. This is of moment not merely for the destiny of the\nJews, whose welfare depends on their sticking together and helping each\nother, but, over and above that, for the cultivation of the international spirit,\nwhich is in danger everywhere to-day from a narrow-minded nationalism.\nHere, since the days of the Prophets, one of the fairest fields of activity has\nlain open to our nation, scattered as it is over the earth and united only by a\ncommon tradition.\nAddresses on Reconstruction in Palestine\nI\n65\nTen years ago, when I first had the pleasure of addressing you on behalf of\nthe Zionist cause, almost all our hopes were still fixed on the future. To-day\nwe can look back on these ten years with joy; for in that time the united\nenergies of the Jewish people have accomplished a splendid piece of\nsuccessful constructive work in Palestine, which certainly exceeds anything\nthat we dared to hope then.\nWe have also successfully stood the severe test to which the events of the last\nfew years have subjected us. Ceaseless work, supported by a noble purpose,\nis leading slowly but surely to success. The latest pronouncements of the\nBritish Government indicate a return to a juster judgment of our case; this we\nrecognize with gratitude.\nBut we must never forget what this crisis has taught us--namely, that the\nestablishment of satisfactory relations between the Jews and the Arabs is not\nEngland's affair but ours. We--that is to say, the Arabs and ourselves--have\ngot to agree on the main outlines of an advantageous partnership which shall\nsatisfy the needs of both nations. A just solution of this problem and one\nworthy of both nations is an end no less important and no less worthy of our\nefforts than the promotion of the work of construction itself. Remember that\nSwitzerland represents a higher stage of political development than any\nnational state, precisely because of the greater political problems which had to\nbe solved before a stable community could be built up out of groups of\ndifferent nationality.\nMuch remains to be done, but one at least of Herzl's aims has already been\nrealized: its task in Palestine has given the Jewish people an astonishing degree\nof solidarity and the optimism without which no organism can lead a healthy\nlife.\nAnything we may do for the common purpose is done not merely for our\nbrothers in Palestine, but for the well-being and honour of the whole Jewish\npeople.\nII\nWe are assembled to-day for the purpose of calling to mind our age-old\ncommunity, its destiny, and its problems.

It is a community of moral tradition,\nwhich has always shown its strength and vitality in times of stress. In all ages it\nhas produced men who embodied the conscience of the Western world,\ndefenders of human dignity and justice.\nSo long as we ourselves care about this community it will continue to exist to\n66\nthe benefit of mankind, in spite of the fact that it possesses no self-contained\norganization. A decade or two ago a group of far-sighted men, among whom\nHerzl of immortal memory stood out above the rest, came to the conclusion\nthat we needed a spiritual centre in crder to preserve our sense of solidarity in\ndifficult times. Thus arose the idea of Zionism and the work of settlement in\nPalestine, the successful realization of which we have been permitted to\nwitness, at least in its highly promising beginnings.\nI have had the privilege of seeing, to my great joy and satisfaction, how much\nthis achievement has contributed to the recovery of the Jewish people, which\nis exposed, as a minority among the nations, not merely to external dangers,\nbut also to internal ones of a psychological nature.\nThe crisis which the work of construction has had to face in the last few years\nhas lain heavy upon us and is not yet completely surmounted. But the most\nrecent reports show that the world, and especially the British Government, is\ndisposed to recognize the great things which lie behind our struggle for the\nZionist ideal. Let us at this moment remember with gratitude our leader\nWeizmann, whose zeal and circumspection have helped the good cause to\nsuccess.\nThe difficulties we have been through have also brought some good in their\ntrain. They have shown us once more how strong the bond is which unites the\nJews of all countries in a common destiny. The crisis has also purified our\nattitude to the question of Palestine, purged it of the dross of nationalism. It\nhas been clearly proclaimed that we are not seeking to create a political\nsociety, but that our aim is, in accordance with the old tradition of Jewry, a\ncultural one in the widest sense of the word. That being so, it is for us to solve\nthe problem of living side by side with our brother the Arab in an open,\ngenerous, and worthy manner. We have here an opportunity of showing what\nwe have learnt in the thousands of years of our martyrdom. If we choose the\nright path we shall succeed and give the rest of the world a fine example.\nWhatever we do for Palestine we do it for the honour and well-being of the\nwhole Jewish people.\nIII\nI am delighted to have the opportunity of addressing a few words to the youth\nof this country which is faithful to the common aims of Jewry. Do not be\ndiscouraged by the difficulties which confront us in Palestine. Such things\nserve to test the will to live of our community.\n67\nCertain proceedings and pronouncements of the English administration have\nbeen justly criticized. We must not, however, leave it at that but learn by\nexperience.\nWe need to pay great attention to our relations with the Arabs. By cultivating\nthese carefully we shall be able in future to prevent things from becoming so\ndangerously strained that people can take advantage of them to provoke acts\nof hostility. This goal is perfectly within our reach, because our work of\nconstruction has been, and must continue to be, carried out in such a manner\nas to serve the real interests of the Arab population also.\nIn this way we shall be able to avoid getting ourselves quite so often into the\nposition, disagreeable for Jews and Arabs alike, of having to call in the\nmandatory Power as arbitrator. We shall thereby be following not merely the\ndictates of Providence but also our traditions, which alone give the Jewish\ncommunity meaning and stability.\nFor that community is not, and must never become, a political one; this is the\nonly permanent source whence it can draw new strength and the only ground\non which its existence can be justified.\nIV\nFor the last two thousand years the common property of the Jewish people\nhas consisted entirely of its past. Scattered over the wide world, our nation\npossessed nothing in common except its carefully guarded tradition. Individual\nJews no doubt produced great work, but it seemed as if the Jewish people as\na whole had not the strength left for great collective achievements.\nNow all that is changed. History has set us a great and noble task in the shape\nof active cooperation in the building up of Palestine. Eminent members of our\nrace are already at work with all their might on the realization of this aim. The\nopportunity is presented to us of setting up centres of civilization which the\nwhole Jewish people can regard as its work. We nurse the hope of erecting in\nPalestine a home of our own national culture which shall help to awaken the\nnear East to new economic and spiritual life.\nThe object which the leaders of Zionism have in view is not a political but a\nsocial and cultural one. The community in Palestine must approach the social\nideal of our forefathers as it is laid down in the Bible, and at the same time\nbecome a seat of modern intellectual life, a spiritual centre for the Jews of the\nwhole world.

The community in Palestine must approach the social\nideal of our forefathers as it is laid down in the Bible, and at the same time\nbecome a seat of modern intellectual life, a spiritual centre for the Jews of the\nwhole world. In accordance with this notion, the establishment of a Jewish\nuniversity in Jerusalem constitutes one of the most important aims of the\n68\nZionist organization.\nDuring the last few months I have been to America in order to help to raise\nthe material basis for this university there. The success of this enterprise was\nquite natural. Thanks to the untiring energy and splendid self-sacrificing spirit\nof the Jewish doctors in America, we have succeeded in collecting enough\nmoney for the creation of a medical faculty, and the preliminary work isbeing\nstarted at once. After this success I have no doubt that the material basis for\nthe other faculties will soon be forthcoming. The medical faculty is first of all to\nbe developed as a research institute and to concentrate on making the country\nhealthy, a most important item in the work of development. Teaching on a\nlarge scale will only become important later on. As a number of highly\ncompetent scientific workers have already signified their readiness to take up\nappointments at the university, the establishment of a medical faculty seems to\nbe placed beyond all doubt. I may add that a special fund for the university,\nentirely distinct from the general fund for the development of the country, has\nbeen opened. For the latter considerable sums have been collected during\nthese months in America, thanks to the indefatigable labours of Professor\nWeizmann and other Zionist leaders, chiefly through the self-sacrificing spirit\nof the middle classes. I conclude with a warm appeal to the Jews in Germany\nto contribute all they can, in spite of the present economic difficulties, for the\nbuilding up of the Jewish home in Palestine. This is not a matter of charity, but\nan enterprise which concerns all Jews and the success of which promises to\nbe a source of the highest satisfaction to all.\nV\nFor us Jews Palestine is not just a charitable or colonial enterprise, but a\nproblem of central importance for the Jewish people. Palestine is not primarily\na place of refuge for the Jews of Eastern Europe, but the embodiment of the\nre-awakening corporate spirit of the whole Jewish nation. Is it the right\nmoment for this corporate sense to be awakened and strengthened? This is a\nquestion to which I feel compelled, not merely by my spontaneous feelings but\non rational grounds, to return an unqualified \"yes.\"\nLet us just cast our eyes over the history of the Jews in Germany during the\npast hundred years. A century ago our forefathers, with few exceptions, lived\nin the ghetto. They were poor, without political rights, separated from the\nGentiles by a barrier of religious traditions, habits of life, and legal restrictions;\ntheir intellectual development was restricted to their own literature, and they\nhad remained almost unaffected by the mighty advance of the European\nintellect which dates from the Renaissance. And yet these obscure, humble\npeople had one great advantage over us each of them belonged in every fibre\n69\nof his being to a community m which he was completely absorbed, in which\nhe felt himself a fully pnvileged member, and which demanded nothing of him\nthat was contrary to his natural habits of thought. Our forefathers in those\ndays were pretty poor specimens intellectually and physically, but socially\nspeaking they enjoyed an enviable spiritual equilibrium.\nThen came emancipation, which suddenly opened up undreamed-of\npossibilities to the individual. Some few rapidly made a position for\nthemselves in the higher walks of business and social life. They greedily\nlapped up the splendid triumphs which the art and science of the Western\nworld had achieved. They joined in the process with burning enthusiasm,\nthemselves making contributions of lasting value. At the same time they\nimitated the external forms of Gentile life, departed more and more from their\nreligious and social traditions, and adopted Gentile customs, manners, and\nhabits of thought. It seemed as though they were completely losing their\nidentity in the superior numbers and more highly organized culture of the\nnations among whom they lived, so that in a few generations there would be\nno trace of them left. A complete disappearance of Jewish nationality in\nCentral and Western Europe seemed inevitable.\nBut events turned out otherwise. Nationalities of different race seem to have\nan instinct which prevents them from fusing. However much the Jews adapted\nthemselves, in language, manners, and to a great extent even in the forms of\nreligion, to the European peoples among whom they lived, the feeling of\nstrangeness between the Jews and their hosts never disappeared. This\nspontaneous feeling is the ultimate cause of anti-Semitism, which is therefore\nnot to be got rid of by well-meaning propaganda. Nationalities want to pursue\ntheir own path, not to blend. A satisfactory state of affairs can be brought\nabout only by mutual toleration and respect.\nThe first step in that direction is that we Jews should once more become\nconscious of our existence as a nationality and regain the self-respect that is\nnecessary to a healthy existence. We must learn once more to glory in our\nancestors and our history and once again take upon ourselves, as a nation,\ncultural tasks of a sort calculated to strengthen our sense of the community. It\nis not enough for us to play a part",

It\nis not enough for us to play a part as individuals in the cultural development of\nthe human race, we must also tackle tasks which only nations as a whole can\nperform. Only so can the Jews regain social health.\nIt is from this point of view that I would have you look at the Zionist\nmovement. To-day history has assigned to us the task of taking an active part\nin the economic and cultural reconstruction of our native land. Enthusiasts,\nmen of brilliant gifts, have cleared the way, and many excellent members of\n70\nour race are prepared to devote themselves heart and soul to the cause. May\nevery one of them fully realize the importance of this work and contribute,\naccording to his powers, to its success!\nThe Jewish Community\nA speech in London\nLadies and Gentlemen,\nIt is no easy matter for me to overcome my natural inclination to a life of quiet\ncontemplation. But I could not remain deaf to the appeal of the O.R.T. and\nO.Z.E. societies*; for in responding to it I am responding, as it were, to the\nappeal of our sorely oppressed Jewish nation.\nThe position of our scattered Jewish community is a moral barometer for the\npolitical world. For what surer index of political morality and respect for\njustice can there be than the attitude of the nations towards a defenceless\nminority, whose peculiarity lies in their preservation of an ancient cultural\ntradition?\n *Jewish charitable associations.\nThis barometer is low at the present moment, as we are painfully aware from\nthe way we are treated. But it is this very lowness that confirms me in the\nconviction that it is our duty to preserve and consolidate our community.\nEmbedded in the tradition of the Jewish people there is a love of justice and\nreason which must continue to work for the good of all nations now and in the\nfuture. In modern times this tradition has produced Spinoza and Karl Marx.\nThose who would preserve the spirit must also look after the body to which it\nis attached. The O.Z.E. society literally looks after the bodies of our people.\nIn Eastern Europe it is working day and night to help our people there, on\nwhom the economic depression has fallen particularly heavily, to keep body\nand soul together; while the O.R.T. society is trying to get rid of a severe\nsocial and economic handicap under which the Jews have laboured since the\nMiddle Ages. Because we were then excluded from all directly productive\noccupations, we were forced into the purely commercial ones. The only way\nof really helping the Jew in Eastern countries is to give him access to new\nfields of activity, for which he is struggling all over the world. This is the grave\nproblem which the O.R.T. society is successfully tackling.\nIt is to you English fellow-Jews that we now appeal to help us in this great\n71\nenterprise which splendid men have set on foot. The last few years, nay, the\nlast few days, have brought us a disappointment which must have touched you\nin particular nearly. Do not gird at fate, but rather look on these events as a\nreason for remaining true to the cause of the Jewish commonwealth. I am\nconvinced that in doing that we shall also indirectly be promoting those\ngeneral human ends which we must always recognize as the highest.\nRemember that difficulties and obstacles are a valuable source of health and\nstrength to any society. We should not have survived for thousands of years\nas a community if our bed had been of roses; of that I am quite sure.\nBut we have a still fairer consolation. Our friends are not exactly numerous,\nbut among them are men of noble spirit and strong sense of justice, who have\ndevoted their lives to uplifting human society and liberating the individual from\ndegrading oppression.\nWe are happy and fortunate to have such men from the Gentile world among\nus to-night; their presence lends an added solemnity to this memorable\nevening. It gives me great pleasure to see before me Bernard Shaw and H. G.\nWells, to whose view of life I am particularly attracted.\nYou, Mr. Shaw, have succeeded in winning the affection and joyous\nadmiration of the world while pursuing a path that has led many others to a\nmartyr's crown. You have not merely preached moral sermons to your\nfellows; you have actually mocked at things which many of them held sacred.\nYou have done what only the born artist can do. From your magic box you\nhave produced innumerable little figures which, while resembling human\nbeings, are compact not of flesh and blood, but of brains, wit, and charm.\nAnd yet in a way they are more human than we are ourselves, and one almost\nforgets that they are creations not of Nature, but of Bernard Shaw. You make\nthese charming little figures dance in a miniature world in front of which the\nGraces stand sentinel and permit no bitterness to enter. He who has looked\ninto this little world sees our actual world in a new light; its puppets insinuate\nthemselves into real people, making them suddenly look quite different.

By lightening their heavy lot as far as\nwe can we shall be saving the most valuable sort of human life; for the first\nsettlers' struggle on ground not yet made habitable is a difficult and dangerous\nbusiness involving a heavy personal sacrifice. How true this is, only they can\njudge who have seen it with their own eyes. Anyone who helps to improve the\nequipment of these men is helping on the good work at a crucial point.\nIt is, moreover, this working class alone that has it in its power to establish\nhealthy relations with the Arabs, which is the most important political task of\nZionism. Administrations come and go; but it is human relations that finally\nturn the scale in the lives of nations. Therefore to support \"Working Palestine\"\nis at the same time to promote a humane and worthy policy in Palestine, and\nto oppose an effective resistance to those undercurrents of narrow nationalism\nfrom which the whole political world, and in a less degree the small political\nworld of Palestine affairs, is suffering.\nJewish Recovery\nI gladly accede to your paper's request that I should address an appeal to the\nJews of Hungary on behalf of Keren Hajessod.\nThe greatest enemies of the national consciousness and honour of the Jews\nare fatty degeneration--by which I mean the unconscionableness which comes\nfrom wealth and ease--and a kind of inner dependence on the surrounding\nGentile world which comes from the loosening of the fabric of Jewish society.\nThe best in man can flourish only when he loses himself in a community.\n73\nHence the moral danger of the Jew who has lost touch with his own people\nand is regarded as a foreigner by the people of his adoption. Only too often a\ncontemptible and joyless egoism has resulted from such circumstances. The\nweight of outward oppression on the Jewish people is particularly heavy at the\nmoment. But this very bitterness has done us good. A revival of Jewish\nnational life, such as the last generation could never have dreamed of, has\nbegun. Through the operation of a newly awakened sense of solidarity among\nthe Jews, the scheme of colonizing Palestine launched by a handful of devoted\nand judicious leaders in the face of apparently insuperable difficulties, has\nalready prospered so far that I feel no doubt about its permanent success.\nThe value of this achievement for the Jews everywhere is very great. Palestine\nwill be a centre of culture for all Jews, a refuge for the most grievously\noppressed, a field of action for the best among us, a unifying ideal, and a\nmeans of attaining inward health for the Jews of the whole world.\nAnti-Semitism and Academic Youth\nSo long as we lived in the ghetto our Jewish nationality involved for us\nmaterial difficulties and sometimes physical danger, but no social or\npsychological problems. With emancipation the position changed, particularly\nfor those Jews who turned to the intellectual professions. In school and at the\nuniversity the young Jew is exposed to the influence of a society with a definite\nnational tinge, which he respects and admires, from which he receives his\nmental sustenance, to which he feels himself to belong, while it, on the other\nhand, treats him, as one of an alien race, with a certain contempt and hostility.\nDriven by the suggestive influence of this psychological superiority rather than\nby utilitarian considerations, he turns his back on his people and his traditions,\nand considers himself as belonging entirely to the others while he tries in vain\nto conceal from himself and them the fact that the relation is not reciprocal.\nHence that pathetic creature, the baptized Jewish Geheimrat of yesterday\nand to-day. In most cases it is not pushfulness and lack of character that have\nmade him what he is, but, as I have said, the suggestive power of an",

He knows, of course, that\nmany admirable sons of the Jewish people have made important contributions\nto the glory of European civilization; but have they not all, with a few\nexceptions, done much the same as he?\nIn this case, as in many mental disorders, the cure lies in a clear knowledge of\none's condition and its causes. We must be conscious of our alien race and\ndraw the logical conclusions from it. It is no use trying to convince the others\nof our spiritual and intellectual equality by arguments addressed to the reason,\nwhen their attitude does not originate in their intellects at all. Rather must we\nemancipate ourselves socially and supply our social needs, in the main,\n74\nourselves. We must have our own students' societies and adopt an attitude of\ncourteous but consistent reserve to the Gentiles. And let us live after our own\nfashion there and not ape duelling and drinking customs which are foreign to\nour nature. It is possible to be a civilized European and a good citizen and at\nthe same time a faithful Jew who loves his race and honours his fathers. If we\nremember this and act accordingly, the problem of anti-Semitism, in so far as\nit is of a social nature, is solved for us.\nA Letter to Professor Dr. Hellpach, Minister of State\n Dear Herr Hellpach,\n I have read your article on Zionism and the Zurich Congress and\n feel, as a strong devotee of the Zionist idea, that I must answer\n you, even if it is only shortly.\n The Jews are a community bound together by ties of blood and\n tradition, and not of religion only: the attitude of the rest of the\n world towards them is sufficient proof of this. When I came to\n Germany fifteen years ago I discovered for the first time that I\n was a Jew, and I owe this discovery more to Gentiles than Jews.\n The tragedy of the Jews is that they are people of a definite\n historical type, who lack the support of a community to keep\n them together. The result is a want of solid foundations in the\n individual which amounts in its extremer forms to moral\n instability. I realized that the only possible salvation for the race\n was that every Jew in the world should become attached to a\n living society to which the individual rejoiced to belong and\n which enabled him to bear the hatred and the humiliations that he\n has to put up with from the rest of the world.\n I saw worthy Jews basely caricatured, and the sight made my\n heart bleed. I saw how schools, comic papers, and innumerable\n other forces of the Gentile majority undermined the confidence\n even of the best of my fellow-Jews, and felt that this could not\n be allowed to continue.\n Then I realized that only a common enterprise dear to the hearts\n of Jews all over the world could restore this people to health. It\n was a great achievement of Herzl's to have realized and\n proclaimed at the top of his voice that, the traditional attitude of\n the Jews being what it was, the establishment of a national home\n75\n or, more accurately, a centre in Palestine, was a suitable object\n on which to concentrate our efforts.\n All this you call nationalism, and there is something in the\n accusation. But a communal purpose, without which we can\n neither live nor die in this hostile world, can always be called by\n that ugly name. In any case it is a nationalism whose aim is not\n power but dignity and health. If we did not have to live among\n intolerant, narrow-minded, and violent people, I should be the\n first to throw over all nationalism in favour of universal humanity.\n The objection that we Jews cannot be proper citizens of the\n German State, for example, if we want to be a \"nation,\" is based\n on a misunderstanding of the nature of the State which springs\n from the intolerance of national majorities. Against that\n intolerance we shall never be safe, whether we call ourselves a\n \"people\" (or \"nation\") or not.\n I have put all this with brutal frankness for the sake of brevity,\n but I know from your writings that you are a man who attends to\n the sense, not the form.\nLetter to an Arab\nMarch 15, 1930\nSir,\nYour letter has given me great pleasure. It shows me that there is good will\navailable on your side too for solving the present difficulties in a manner\nworthy of both our nations. I believe that these difficulties are more\npsychological than real, and that they can be got over if both sides bring\nhonesty and good will to the task.\nWhat makes the present position so bad is the fact that Jews and Arabs\nconfront each other as opponents before the mandatory power. This state of\naffairs is unworthy of both nations and can only be altered by our finding a via\nmedia on which both sides agree.\nI will now tell you how I think that the present difficulties might be remedied;\nat the same time I must add that this is only my personal opinion, which I have\ndiscussed with nobody. I am writing this letter in German because I am not\ncapable of writing it in English myself and because I want myself",

If one of the elective bodies above\nspecified is dissatisfied with a resolution of the Council, it may repiace its\nrepresentative by another.\nEven if this \"Privy Council\" has no definite powers it may nevertheless bring\nabout the gradual composition of differences, and secure as united\nrepresentation of the common interests of the country before the mandatory\npower, clear of the dust of ephemeral politics.\nChristianity and Judaism\nIf one purges the Judaism of the Prophets and Christianity as Jesus Christ\ntaught it of all subsequent additions, especially those of the priests, one is left\nwith a teaching which is capable of curing all the social ills of humanity.\nIt is the duty of every man of good will to strive steadfastly in his own little\nworld to make this teaching of pure humanity a living force, so far as he can.

The discussion between the two great\nmen was recorded, and was subsequently published in the\nJanuary, 1931 issue of Modern Review.\nTAGORE: You have been busy, hunting down with mathemat-\nics, the two ancient entities, time and space, while I have been\nlecturing in this country on the eternal world of man, the uni-\nverse of reality.\nEINSTEIN: Do you believe in the divine isolated from the world?\nTAGORE: Not isolated. The infinite personality of man com-\nprehends the universe. There cannot be anything that cannot\nbe subsumed by the human personality, and this proves that the\ntruth of the universe is human truth.\nEINSTEIN: There are two different conceptions about the na-\nture of the universe — the world as a unity dependent on human-\nity, and the world as reality independent of the human factor.\nTAGORE: When our universe is in harmony with man, the eter-\nnal, we know it as truth, we feel it as beauty.\nEINSTEIN: This is a purely human conception of the universe.\nTAGORE: The world is a human world — the scientific view\nof it is also that of the scientific man. Therefore, the world\n1\napart from us does not exist; it is a relative world, depending\nfor its reality upon our consciousness. There is some standard\nof reason and enjoyment which gives it truth, the standard of\nthe eternal man whose experiences are made possible through\nour experiences.\nEINSTEIN: This is a realization of the human entity.\nTAGORE: Yes, one eternal entity. We have to realize it through\nour emotions and activities. We realize the supreme man, who\nhas no individual limitations, through our limitations.\nScience is concerned with that which is not confined to individu-\nals; it is the impersonal human world of truths. Religion realizes\nthese truths and links them up with our deeper needs. Our indi-\nvidual consciousness of truth gains universal significance. Reli-\ngion applies values to truth, and we know truth as good through\nown harmony with it.\nEINSTEIN: Truth, then, or beauty, is not independent of man?\nTAGORE: No, I do not say so.\nEINSTEIN: If there were no human beings any more, the Apollo\nBelvedere no longer would be beautiful?\nTAGORE: No!\nEINSTEIN: I agree with this conception of beauty, but not with\nregard to truth.\nTAGORE: Why not? Truth is realized through men.\nEINSTEIN: I cannot prove my conception is right, but that is\nmy religion.\nTAGORE: Beauty is in the ideal of perfect harmony, which is\nin the universal being; truth is the perfect comprehension of\nthe universal mind.
