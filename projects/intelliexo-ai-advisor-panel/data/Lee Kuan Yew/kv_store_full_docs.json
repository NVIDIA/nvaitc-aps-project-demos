LEE KUAN YEW, TO FOUR FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS ON\n\nAUGUST 14,1965, AT THE STUDIOS OF TELEVISION SINGAPURA.\n\n The Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, will be interviewed\n\nby four correspondents.  My name is Richard Croll from Channel 7  in Sydney.\n\n My name is Sam Lipski from the Australian Bulletin; Gavin Young, I am\n\nfrom the London Observer.\n\n My name is Rene Muccoll, Chief Foreign Correspondent of the London\n\nDaily Express.\n\nMr. Croll:\n\nMr. Lee Kuan Yew, Tengku Abdul Rahman has said that you\n\nwere pleased and wanted to get out of the Federation.  And\n\nyet in your last Monday's press conference you broke down.\n\nWhere, would you say, the truth lies?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nDid the Tengku say I was pleased?\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nHe said this yesterday.\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\fMr. Lee :\n\nWhere?\n\n2\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nHe said you wanted to get out and that you are pleased to get\n\nout.\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nNo, no, no.  I haven't seen it in the press.\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nHe said this at a press conference yesterday in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nWell, I am sorry to hear that because I do not want to believe\n\nthat the Tengku would utter something which is not truth.\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nHis actual words were.\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nHe knows my positions; and he knew how close it came to a\n\nreal collision because my colleagues were not prepared to\n\ngive way.  You know, half my Cabinet were born and bred in\n\nMalaya.  Their families are there.  You mean to tell me you\n\ncan abandon them like that?  And they are abandoned now.\n\nThey are foreigners now.  My colleagues fought with me\n\nagainst the Communists.  What for?  To bring Singapore into\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f3\n\nMalaya in order to lift up Malaya: bring fresh air, social\n\ndevelopment, economic development.  I am not saying it is all\n\npurely personal, that is just because they have got their\n\nfamilies there.  But they were born, bred, rooted there.  They\n\njust happened to have come down to Singapore which was\n\nthe biggest city in South-East Asia.  And they made a living\n\nhere and they finally became ministers here.  You think you\n\ncan face your Cabinet colleagues.  Let me put it in another\n\nway.  Supposing Mr. Menzies were presented with an\n\nultimatum  by the American President that either Victoria gets\n\nout or the ANZUS pact is not valid.  You think Mr. Menzies\n\nwill be pleased and happy?  It is easier for me.  My family is\n\nhere; born, bred, there; their families still there.  How do they\n\nface their families?  And they signed, you know.  And I\n\nwould not have signed unless they all signed.  I am not the\n\nTengku, I am not a prince.  I cannot just sign it, and they\n\nsigned with the utmost reluctance.  And for them, when they\n\nlook back at that moment, it will be a moment of anguish.  It\n\nis going back on everything we fought for and believed in.\n\nAnd I do not care what nobody else says.\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f4\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nMr. Lee, were there any reasonable alternatives that the other\n\nmembers of your cabinet put forward  at the time that looked\n\nas if they had a chance, other than complete secession?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nI met the Tengku on Saturday, the 7th at half-past 12.  I\n\nremember it distinctly.  The appointment was supposed to be\n\nat 12 o'clock.  I arrived.  I waited for him for half an hour.\n\nSome of his ministers were there.  We talked little nothings.\n\nHe came and we went to a separate room.  I said, \"Tengku, is\n\nthere no other way?\n\nWhy not loosen it into a confederation?  Give me common\n\nmarket.  We will run all our activities ourselves.  We will go\n\nslow in the rest of Malaysia.  Give me common market; give\n\nme the right to take initiative in security matters so that the\n\ncommunists cannot start riots in Singapore, and we carry on\n\nin Malaysia slowly:  take it in 20, 30 years.  And he said,\n\n\"No\".  I said, \"My colleagues, Dr. Toh?\"  Dr. Toh was born\n\nand bred in Taiping; his family is there.  Every year, he does\n\na bi-annual pilgrimage.  You know, Chinese families have\n\nreunions:  Chinese New Year and some other moon festivals.\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f5\n\nDr. Toh is not going to say \"Yes\".  For two million people\n\nmoving forward faster and quicker, we abandoned eight\n\nmillion people; abandoned them and left them in a slow and\n\nsluggish situation.  And the Tengku did not want to see Dr.\n\nToh .  But he wrote Dr. Toh that letter and Dr. Toh did not\n\nreply.  One whole night we sat down and argued.  It is all\n\nover.  Never mind about that.  We will talk about that later\n\non.  It is part of the history now of South-East Asia.\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nThere seems to be some contradiction here though, Sir. And\n\nis it a fact, for instance, that Dato Ja'afar Albar wanted to\n\nsuspend the Constitution and rule by edict and possibly to jail\n\nyou.  And in fact that the alternative that was suggested was\n\neither that you resign from here or separation?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nWell, those who are unkind, those who do not like us will say\n\nthat my colleagues and I were afraid for our personal safety\n\nand freedom and therefore we signed.  But amongst my\n\ncolleagues are quite a number who have been to British jails.\n\nMr. Jek, for instance, Mr. Devan Nair.  I do not think they are\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f6\n\nafraid of going to jail.  But we sat down and calculated that if\n\nthe Tengku really could not keep his ultras down.  Going to\n\njail means I became a martyr.  I must come out.  Mr. Wilson\n\nwho is a personal friend cannot see me languishing in jail for\n\never.  I do not think Mr. Menzies, even though his political\n\norientation is different from mine but he is a human being,\n\nhe knew that we were fighting for something which was\n\nvaluable for Australia.  He cannot see me languishing in jail.\n\nIn one or two years, I would have come out.\n\nQuestion :\n\nThis was the alternative then that was given.\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nNo, no, ,no.\n\nQuestion :\n\nIs it what Dato Ja'afar Albar wanted?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nWell, of course, that was what he wanted, isn’t it?  The man\n\ncannot think beyond the next election.\n\nQuestion :\n\nThe Tengku said yesterday that he was in control, sir, and in\n\nhis letter he said he wasn't.  Where do you think, the truth lies\n\nthere?\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f7\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nNo, it is not fair.  You had better ask the Tengku.  As far as I\n\nam concerned, I hope he is in. Syed Ja'afar Albar, now that he\n\nis out, I hope the Tengku will ensure that.  There are five\n\nothers, you know, with Albar.  And if the Tengku wants to\n\nmake sure that Malaysia, even though it has not got\n\nSingapore, I think these five should become ambassadors or\n\n...  There are very good jobs and important jobs like\n\ncompiling dictionaries for those interested in language,\n\nanthology of Malay poetry and so on.  But you keep on\n\npushing this around, I do not think the people in Malaya,\n\nSabah and Sarawak are going to keep quiet just because the\n\nPAP is out.  They cannot.  Human beings.  You know\n\nShakespears?  The seven stages of man.  And a lot of the\n\npeople leading political parties are in that stages where they\n\nare no longer interested in fame and glories.  They are\n\ninterested in the future and what place their progeny will have\n\nin Malaysia.  And they must fight.\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nSir, the Tengku has said he wanted utmost secrecy and that\n\nhe feared bloodshed.  Now, is that the reason why you went\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f8\n\nalong with him from the secrecy point point of view?  Did\n\nyou fear bloodshed?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nYes, surely.\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nDid you fear that troops would be sent down?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nNo, no, no.  Not that troops would be sent down.\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nOr that it would be a matter that they would possibly try and\n\ntake over the government here and ....\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nNo.  We are not afraid of that.  Let us say that they take over\n\nthe Government and rule by edict.  Right?  Some of my\n\ncolleagues will be away.  We will have a government in exile.\n\nWe were prepared for that.  Prince Sihanouk is a very\n\npersonal friend of mine and Phnom Penh is very close to\n\nMalaysia.  I would be in jail because I cannot run away.  But\n\nquite a number of my colleagues who have got international\n\ncontacts could run a much, more effective campaign than the\n\nIndonesians and the Communists ever can.  But I tell you\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f9\n\nwhat detered us:  that in a moment of anger, race conflict\n\ntakes place in Singapore.  The Malays here are in a minority.\n\nThe Chinese thinking that well, if this is it, to hell with\n\nconstitutionalism, they will beat up some completely innocent\n\npeople who have nothing to do with this.  Troops come down;\n\nMalay troops come down, shoot the Chinese.  Do you think it\n\nstays just in Singapore or do you think it spreads throughout\n\nMalaysia?  If I believed that we could go jail. Then telegrams --\n\nSocialist International, British Labour Party -- passed all over\n\nthe place; and we come out and find Malaysia is still one\n\nwhole.  Then we would come out with a medal, isn't it? But I\n\ndo not think we would have come out to Malaysia which was\n\nin one piece.  You have got to calculate.  I may be wrong.  It\n\nmay be that Singapore consists of docile people who could be\n\ncowed and brutalised into submission.  But I don't  think they\n\ncould have.  My estimation was that they would really give\n\nvent to their feelings.  And if this spreads across the\n\nCauseway, the Tengku will have had it, too; because in that\n\nsituation, the gentle, the charming, the soft-spoken leader has\n\nno place.  And I want the Tengku to be there because I\n\nhappen to believe -- not because I like him -- but I happen to\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f10\n\nbelieve that there is a little bit more chance of holding the\n\nmulti-racial situation together with him in charge.\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nMr. Prime Minister, we've dealt with the problem of\n\nseparation and what would happen if you went to jail.  But\n\nwhat about the situation if you personally were to resign?  Do\n\nyou think that would have helped the attitude between\n\nSingapore and Malaya?  Do you think it would have made it\n\nany better?  Kept the Federation together?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nAfter the riots last year they said that if I resigned there\n\nwould be better co-operation.  I told my colleagues if there's\n\ngoing to be co-operation in Singapore and Malaysia will\n\nprosper, let's do it that way. I was even prepared to serve\n\nunder Dr. Toh.  And my colleagues, they've all got a \n\nlittle calculation.  They don't play the thing by ear, take \n\na stick or drop sand and read the palm. I resign, whoever\n\ntakes my place, whether it is Dr.Toh or Dr. Goh, will \n\nhave to prove that he's not a stooge-man. And to do \n\nthat he'll have to take a very firm line.  In fact, much\n\nfirmer, much harder, not just an apparently firm line but\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f11\n\nconcessions and a real hard line.  And they decide it could\n\nnot work.\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nAnd did you agree with this?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nI think that's right.  You see, Singapore knows all of us.\n\nWe've been looking after Singapore now for nearly seven\n\nyears.  They know us as a very closely-knit group.  They also\n\nknow the individual idiosyncracies or differences of style\n\nbetween the ministers.  I do not think Singapore would\n\nbelieve that I resigned because I wanted to go back to the\n\nLaw and make money.\n\nQuestion :\n\nThen it was suggested , Sir, that you do resign, and you\n\nrejected this?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nNo, no.  I didn't reject this.  I was prepared to resign.  But my\n\ncolleagues could not accept it because they would be a worse\n\nposition.  Mr. Tan Siew Sin openly said in Parliament that\n\nthere can be no co-operation with Singapore as long as I am\n\nthe Prime Minister of Singapore.  Now this was said openly\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f12\n\nin Parliament.  Do you think if I resigned, Singapore would\n\nbelieve that there would be co-operation, or that the former\n\nCentral Government which has had its way and now have has\n\ngot its way (in this separation) that they would keep quiet in\n\nthe situation?\n\nMr. Young :           About the future of Singapore, Sir, as long as confrontation\n\ncontinues, Singapore's economy suffers.  If confrontation\n\ndoes continue, how do you feel Singapore's economy can be\n\nassured?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nSingapore has a very resilient, enterprising and resourceful lot\n\nof people.  Everybody thought and perhaps the Indonesians\n\nmight have thought that if they cut us off their trade, chaos\n\nwould be out in the streets hungry and riot and so on. But\n\nit never happened because they've got a great deal of grit\n\nand the will to survive and to work hard.  We'll carry on.\n\nWe'll survive,\n\nMr. Young :           What do you think the chances are now, Sir, for the common\n\nmarket idea between Singapore and Malaysia?\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\fMr. Lee :\n\nWell, you know what the Agreement says.  Annex  'J' which\n\n13\n\nwere the provisions for a common market, has been\n\ncancelled.  It was at Mr. Tan Siew Sin's personal insistence\n\nthat clause be inserted in the Agreement.  But the Tengku\n\nagreed to a clause that there will be either a joint council or\n\nCommittee for economic co-operation. I've told the Tengku\n\nthat without eoconomic co-operation, there will be growing\n\ntroubles in Singapore.  Boys and girls pressing out from\n\nschools, more than there are jobs for them.  And the situation\n\nwould be a bit less stable, a bit more volatile, and the bases\n\nwill be that much more rickety.  The whole thing is inter-\n\nwoven.  I was glad that the Tengku assured me that he\n\nunderstood very clearly that there was a clear nexus between\n\ndefence and security, and commerce or trade and industry.\n\nBut we'll have to go slow.  There must be a thaw first,\n\nbecause over the last one and a half years so many things\n\nhave happened:  attitudes have sort of hardened.  We just\n\nwant to take is easy for a while, and common sense, logic, the\n\nrelentlessness of economics, must prevail.\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\fMr. Croll :\n\nWhat will happen then, Sir, with tariffs on rubber coming\n\n14\n\nacross the border?  What will happen if Malaya goes ahead\n\nwith its idea of this steelworks which they have been\n\nconsidering.\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nTariffs on rubber?\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nYes.  What then would happen if tyres and things and tariffs\n\nat the border?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nNo, no, no.  Let's get this clear.  They have no seaport that\n\ncan export their rubber.\n\nThe bulk of their rubber is exported via the Singapore harbour\n\nby rail or road to Tanjong Pager by ship all over the world.\n\nThey've got Port Swettenham.  They're going to expand it.\n\nThey've got Prai. Their geography - you can't change this.\n\nStamford Raffles chose Singapore.  Why?  It is the\n\nsouthernmost tip of Asia, and the world spins from West to\n\nEast , and as it does that, the waters of the Pacific wash the\n\nshores of Singapore and the Straits of Johore and we've got\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f15\n\nthree natural harbours comparable to any in the world:\n\nTanjong Pagar, Jurong now for the industrial site, the Naval\n\nBase which the Malaysian Navy must still use because they\n\nhaven't got a harbour for their craft and we've agreed that they\n\nwill use it.  So if somebody is mad enough to say \"We won't\n\nexport through Singapore\" then the rubber will pile up in Port\n\nSwettenham and Prai, and there is no use tapping rubber\n\ntrees.\n\nAs for rubber trees, we can sort it out.  They've got Dunlop's\n\nin Kuala Lumpur.  And Dunlop's comes to Singapore free.\n\nWe are what I would call kind and easy without paying\n\nduty.  Do you think that's fair?  Well, if you don't want to buy\n\nany of our Bridgestone only, and not Dunlop's, that's fair\n\nenough.  I don't know how long it will take to percolate down\n\nto their officials, because really a lot of these problems are\n\ncreated by what I would call just petty officialese cussedness.\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nWould you say, Sir, that Indonesian trade with you is worth\n\nfour hundred million a year approximately, if the total was\n\neight hundred million before?  And would you say that there\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f16\n\nhas been a flow of liquidity from Singapore over the last six\n\nmonths?  And therefore, would you try and re-open trade with\n\nIndonesia in spite of the Tengku's remark that it this would be\n\na hostile act and something would have to be done?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nNo, no.  You're asking me several questions.  Let's get it one\n\nat a time.\n\nThe trade with Indonesia amounted to only 20 percent of our\n\ntotal entreport trade.  Remember that.  It is not Indonesia\n\nalone which makes Singapore tick.  It's just one part, one\n\nfifth, and that one fifth ships have been diverted to\n\nSihanoukville to Bangkok, to other places, doing other trade\n\nand to Sabah and Sarawak.  It's only 20 percent.  We are not\n\ngoing to jeopardise our long term survival.  And our long-term\n\nsurvival demands that there is no Government in Malaysia\n\nwhich would go with the Indonesians and then between\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia and Singapore in between, life will\n\nbe a little bit difficult.  So, I have not the slightest intention of\n\nupsetting the Tengku on this.  But I want to be friends with\n\nIndonesia, always have been friends.  The last time I met Dr.\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f17\n\nSubandrio at Bangkok airport on his way though, just before\n\nConfrontation began, he tapped my knee and said, \"Well,\n\nnever mind.  You and I, we are friends\".  And I hope,\n\npersonally I mean, he and I are still friends.  And I've never\n\nsaid a harsh word about him, and he has not said a harsh word\n\nabout me.  But he's got his problems. My paramount interest\n\nis my right to live in my own home my own way.  I order the\n\nfurniture in my house the way I like it.  My neighbour cannot\n\ntell me whether I should have my chair here, or my radio\n\nthere.  This is my little house.  It's a small house.  They are\n\n103 million.  They are big. I am not telling them how they\n\nshould run Indonesia because ...\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nBut the Tengku is telling you not to trade with them.\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nYou know, sometimes the Tengku says these things without\n\nknowing the full story of what we have said.\n\nMr. Muccoll :\n\nBut the Prime Minister, he said in the last few days.  He said\n\nit to some of us the day before yesterday.  He repeated it\n\nagain to a group of Japanese journalists yesterday, and he\n\nsaid specifically that if you opened trade negotiations with\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f18\n\nIndonesia, or if it is permitted that the Indonesians opened a\n\nConsulate-General.\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nNo, no, no, ..  That's different.\n\n Mr. Muccoll :        Well, he mentioned both things.\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nLet me put it in another way.\n\nMr. Muccoll :      There was an implicit threat in what he said.\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nYes, that's the trouble, you see.  Everytime a phrase is put in\n\nthe form of a threat, my position becomes more difficult. I do\n\nnot want to jeopardise Malaysia's security because my water-\n\nsupply comes from Johore.\n\nMr. Muccoll :         He said he wouldn't take this action, but he said he would \n\ntake others which he wouldn't disclose.\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nYou mean...\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\fMr. Croll :\n\nHe said Malaysia must be forced to do something if\n\n19\n\nSingapore did anything with Indonesia which would endanger\n\nMalaysia and it would be a highly hostile act to trade with\n\nIndonesia.  He was then asked, would he cut the water pipe-\n\nline.  He said, no, he wouldn't do that.  He was asked what he\n\nwould do, and he laughed and said \"well, we must keep\n\nsomethings secret but we could do things.\"\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nWell, I am grateful for the assurance that he will honour the\n\nAgreement, that the water Agreement stands.  But, let me put\n\nit in another way.\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nWhat do you think he could do, sir?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nI don't know.  There are quite a number of things, and to each\n\none of them there are quite a number of counters.  But this is\n\na waste of time talking about these things, isn't it?  Let me\n\nfirst answer Mr. Muccoll.  Look, Britain still has an\n\nAmbassador in Djakarka, isn't it?\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f20\n\nI don't propose to send an Ambassador to Djakarta.  Now, let\n\nus assume that the Indonesians say, \"Let's buy and sell\n\nbecause we need Singapore's soft drinks and manufactures,\n\nand so on, and we don't know what to do with this dirty\n\nrubber, very low grade rubber which only Singapore has got\n\nthe facilities to clean, to re-pack, refurnish and so on.\" \"Let us\n\nsay he says, \"Right, Pulau Samboe\"  that's an Indonesian\n\nisland,  right?  \"We will meet in Pulau Samboe and trade.\"\n\nThis is purely military and other officials to see that there is\n\nno infiltration, there is no smuggling of guns and weapons I'm\n\nnot calculating just for tomorrow.  If he succeed in breaking\n\nin Malaysia, do you think they will leave Singapore alone,\n\nand leave the water flowing into Singapore?  I am not saying\n\nI'm doing this because I'm a friend of the Tengku or I'm a\n\nfriend of Dr. Ismail.  I'm doing this because I have a\n\nresponsibility for the survival of the 2 million people in\n\nSingapore.  I thought that the survival was best secured by 11\n\nmillion people, then it would have been like a stool on three\n\nlegs.  A three-legged stool:  firm; stable.  Now I have only got\n\none leg.  But if  I may put it in the metaphor: now it's like a\n\nshooting-stick.  We are resting on a shooting-stick.  But let\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f21\n\nme just add this and I hope you won't think I'm immodest\n\nabout my people.  I am proud of them. They've got steel in\n\nthem, and that shooting-stick is made of steel.  It may not be\n\nas comfortable as the stool, but it will stand.\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nWe're not talking about steel, Mr. Prime Minister, We're\n\ntalking about liquidity in them.  Liquidity has been going out\n\nof Singapore over the last six months?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nOh yes, before.  Perhaps if I had a few million dollars which\n\nI don't have unfortunately because all Singapore Ministers are\n\nas poor as when they started office 7 years ago but\n\nsuppossing somebody, a great grand-uncle left me $15 million\n\nin Malaya, I think I'll put a bit somewhere else may be\n\nSwitzerland, and may be even Singapore.  Singapore is the\n\nheart of South-East Asia; it is the lynch-pin isn't it?  You take\n\nout this lynch-pin and you tell me what sense you make of\n\nVietnam and all the American commitments and all the\n\ndangerous escalation going on is worth.  The lynch-pin gone,\n\ndo you send marines to Vietnam?  We have done our\n\ncalculation backwards and forwards.  My colleagues and I --\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f22\n\nwe slept very fitfully the last few nights because we\n\ncalculated all this.  Some of it, of course, we calculated since\n\nlast December, when the first proposals were a looser\n\nfederation.  So, we calculated every conceivable aspect.  And\n\nI say there is a lynch-pin.  You know my position:  I am\n\ncommitted.,  But if you push me to the wall and cut off the\n\nwater and try and struggle Singapore, I say any Government\n\nwhether it is anti-communist or non-Communist, which is\n\nwhat we are.  I am not going to join any power bloc, to help\n\nFormosa liberate the mainland or liberate Eastern Europe.\n\nThat is all mad talk.\n\nI'm non-communist because I don't want to be involved... I'm\n\nnon-aligned as far as power-bloc conflicts are concerned.  But\n\nI am not neutral where my survival is concerned:  my people's\n\nsurvival.  I am determined that they will survive; and I think\n\nthey got enough grit in them.\n\nMr. Lipski:\n\nSir, could you perhaps elaborate on what you have already\n\nsaid about the proposed constitutional provisions that you\n\nhope will secure this very survival that you are talking about?\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f23\n\nSpecifically,  in what way do you think it might work to\n\nprevent any future communist subversion?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nI have asked the Chief Justice.  He is going to this Sydney\n\nConference I think all the Commonwealth Chief Justices will\n\nbe there and I want two things done.  First, to ensure that\n\nnobody can come into power and then squat and say, \"No\n\nmore elections\".  That is number one.  Second, to ensure that\n\nnobody under the guise of democratic exercises, works\n\ntowards undemocratic ends.  That is one part of it.  And the\n\nother part is to ensure that Singapore is not going to be like\n\nother countries.  We had the unique experience of the last two\n\nyears, and everybody in Singapore - Chinese, Malays, Indians,\n\nCeylonese, Pakistanis, Eurasians - everybody knows what\n\nbitterness is caused when one group thinks it can assimilate\n\nor otherwise make the others look, be like them.  I want\n\nprovisions put in to ensure that every minority group cannot\n\nbe discriminated against; will be given every opportunity with\n\neverybody else.  And that no Government can remove them.\n\nI'll tell you this.  I don't expect to live forever nor will my\n\ncolleagues live forever.  We will probably stand more than a\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f24\n\ngood chance in the next elections in 1968, but I am not\n\nthinking of 1968 alone.  We can fly in an aeroplane and it\n\nmay drop down; and something may happen; a few ministers\n\ndisappear; elections something goes wrong or, I have said, a\n\nbus may knock some of my ministers down or somebody can\n\narrange for a bus to knock us down.  And these are things\n\nwhich do happen in South-East Asia, But whatever happens, I\n\nwant built-in safeguards in so far as it is possible; and\n\nanybody who acts against them, against these safeguards, will\n\nhave a very difficult time to live it down.\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nMr. Prime Minister; you have some communists in detention I\n\nthink they were first put in there by Tun Lim Yew Hock and\n\nthen later, I think it was the Tengku, after Federation, that\n\nactually re-committed them after they had been out, and held\n\npositions.  As Prime Minister now or a sovereign state, do\n\nyou intend to keep them there or will they be released?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nI do not think they are of any importance at the moment.  It is\n\na very unimportant subject.  You know in the last elections,\n\nthe Communist United Front Barisan Sosialis used them as\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f25\n\nthe election draw.  All their posters were nothing but pictures\n\nof their so-called martyrs.  Well, the people did not think they\n\nwere martyrs because they were the boys who helped the\n\nparatroopers come in, helped to explode a few bombs and\n\ngrenades.  So they do not really matter.  When Singapore has\n\nsettled more urgent issues first, our relationship with the\n\nAfro-Asian countries I have to explain my position because\n\nsome of the Afro-Asian countries although they know me and\n\nthey know that I am not a little puppet, may be a little bit\n\nunhappy about the bases.  But, I want to explain that.  I\n\ncannot make a concession there because this is my survival .\n\nIf they can devise a formula whereby my survival is secured\n\nand not just my survival, my survival and Malaysia's survival\n\nbecause the nexus is too tight then I am prepared to listen; but\n\nthere is no alternative.  There must be some defence\n\narrangement which will prevent a bigger neighbour with a\n\nvaster army, much greater fire power from just over-running\n\nus.  That is number one.  And I'll face a problem which I have\n\nto resolve and I am hoping Mr. Rajaratnam and a few others,\n\nthe moment he settles some of the urgent problems will be\n\nable to help clarify.  That is number one.  Then there is the\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f26\n\neconomic side;   this co-operation every day Singapore helps\n\ndefend Malaysia, Singapore is in danger if Indonesian\n\nterritories coming in just to teach us a lesson, isn't it?  And I\n\nhave got to help Malaysia because of my water and my\n\nhinterland.  And when all these other things have been settled\n\nthe constitution and so on there are several chief justices I\n\nhope who can be persuaded to help, and I am hoping, my\n\nChief Justice will also be able to get a few of our own local\n\nlawyers of standing to spend their time helping, doing this.\n\nWhen all these things are over we will review the matter\n\nprobably next year.  We will review it first, from the point of\n\ntheir danger to the security of, not just Singapore alone but of\n\nMalaysia.  If letting them out means suddenly they slip to the\n\nRhio Islands, get training on how to use the burp gun and\n\nthen come back -- well, I say we had better keep them happy.\n\nDoctors visit them regularly, two eggs for breakfast, quarter\n\npound of butter a day, half pound of meat, rice, vegetables.\n\nYou know, it is very easy.  You can take an outboard motor\n\nand in half-an-hour, you are in Indonesia.  And three months\n\nlater, you come back with a burp gun or whatever the\n\nIndonesians have stay put until they convince us or rather.  I\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f27\n\nwon't have so much time, they will have to convince Dr. Goh\n\nKeng Swee, Minister for Defence and Security; and they\n\nknow that Dr. Goh knows all about Marxism-Leninism..\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nOne last question, Sir, If you were the Prime Minister of\n\nAustralia, and you were looking North to a country that was\n\nunstable..\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nWhich country is unstable?\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nMalaysia.\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nI would have thought that Malaysia is far more stable than\n\nsome of our neighbours around us and much closer to you.\n\nMr. Croll :             Well, in which there has just been separation and signs of\n\ninherent problems .. would you...\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nThe problems are there, but look, let us....\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f28\n\nMr. Croll :             Would you still ask for and would you still send troops to this\n\ncountry to help defend it.\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nFirst, I am not Sir Robert Menzies.  He is a generation older\n\nthan me.  He is much more wise in the ways of men and\n\nnations.  Second, I am not an Australian.  Third, even if I\n\nwere, I think it would be impertinent of me to tell Sir Robert\n\nwhat he should do.  But I think certain facts Sir Robert must\n\nknow:  That whatever it is even after Singapore's very\n\ndifficult position now.. surrounded by Malaysia, it is a far\n\nhealthier situation than your immediate northern neighbour.\n\nSo you have got to calculate on that basis; but what you do is\n\nfor me to say.\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nYou would still ask for this help?\n\nMr. Lee :\n\nI am prepared to get help from anybody, any part of the world\n\nbecause, as I have said, my overriding, my paramount duty is\n\nthe survival of my own people.  And I have got a right to do\n\nthat.  And I must do it,\n\nMr. Croll :\n\nThank you very much, Mr. Prime Minister.\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc\n\n\f29\n\n14th August, 1965.\n\nlky\\1965\\lky0814.doc"

    "content": "TRANSCRIPT OF MINISTER MENTOR LEE KUAN YEW’S INTERVIEW WITH\nSETH MYDANS OF NEW YORK TIMES & IHT ON 1 SEPTEMBER 2010.\nMr Lee: “Thank you. When you are coming to 87, you are not very happy..”\nQ: “Not. Well you should be glad that you‟ve gotten way past where most of us\nwill get.”\nMr Lee: “That is my trouble. So, when is the last leaf falling?”\nQ: “Do you feel like that, do you feel like the leaves are coming off?”\nMr Lee: “Well, yes. I mean I can feel the gradual decline of energy and vitality\nand I mean generally every year when you know you are not on the same level\nas last year. But that is life.”\nQ: “My mother used to say never get old.”\nMr Lee: “Well, there you will try never to think yourself old. I mean I keep fit, I\nswim, I cycle.”\nQ: “And yoga, is that right? Meditation?”\nMr Lee: “Yes.”\nQ: “Tell me about meditation?”\nMr Lee: “Well, I started it about two, three years ago when Ng Kok Song, the\nChief Investment Officer of the Government of Singapore Investment\nCorporation, I knew he was doing meditation. His wife had died but he was\ncompletely serene. So, I said, how do you achieve this? He said I meditate\neveryday and so did my wife and when she was dying of cancer, she was totally\n1\nserene because she meditated everyday and he gave me a video of her in her\nlast few weeks completely composed completely relaxed and she and him had\nbeen meditating for years. Well, I said to him, you teach me. He is a devout\nChristian. He was taught by a man called Laurence Freeman, a Catholic. His\nguru was John Main a devout Catholic. When I was in London, Ng Kok Song\nintroduced me to Laurence Freeman. In fact, he is coming on Saturday to visit\nSingapore, and we will do a meditation session. The problem is to keep the\nmonkey mind from running off into all kinds of thoughts. It is most difficult to stay\nfocused on the mantra. The discipline is to have a mantra which you keep\nrepeating in your innermost heart, no need to voice it over and over again\nthroughout the whole period of meditation. The mantra they recommended was\na religious one. Ma Ra Na Ta, four syllables. Come To Me Oh Lord Jesus. So I\nsaid Okay, I am not a Catholic but I will try. He said you can take any other\nmantra, Buddhist Om Mi Tuo Fo, and keep repeating it. To me Ma Ran Na Ta is\nmore soothing. So I used Ma Ra Na Ta. You must be disciplined. I find it helps\nme go to sleep after that. A certain tranquility settles over you. The day‟s\npressures and worries are pushed out. Then there‟s less problem sleeping. I\nmiss it sometimes when I am tired, or have gone out to a dinner and had wine.\nThen I cannot concentrate. Otherwise I stick to it.”\nQ: “So...”\nMr Lee: “.. for a good meditator will do it for half-an-hour. I do it for 20 minutes.\n”\nQ: “So, would you say like your friend who taught you, would you say you are\nserene?”\nMr Lee: “Well, not as serene as he is. He has done it for many years and he is a\ndevout Catholic. That makes a difference. He believes in Jesus. He believes in\nthe teachings of the Bible. He has lost his wife, a great calamity. But the wife\nwas serene. He gave me this video to show how meditation helped her in her\n2\nlast few months. I do not think I can achieve his level of serenity. But I do\nachieve some composure.”\nQ: “And do you find that at this time in your life you do find yourself getting closer\nto religion of one sort or another?”\nMr Lee: “I am an agnostic. I was brought up in a traditional Chinese family with\nancestor worship. I would go to my grandfather‟s grave on All Soul‟s Day which\nis called “Qingming”\n. My father would bring me along, lay out food and candles\nand burn some paper money and kowtow three times over his tombstone. At\nhome on specific days outside the kitchen he would put up two candles with my\ngrandfather‟s picture. But as I grew up, I questioned this because I think this is\nsuperstition. You are gone, you burn paper money, how can he collect the paper\nmoney where he is? After my father died, I dropped the practice. My youngest\nbrother baptised my father as a Christian. He did not have the right to. He was a\ndoctor and for the last weeks before my father‟s life, he took my father to his\nhouse because he was a doctor and was able to keep my father comforted. I do\nnot know if my father was fully aware when he was converted into Christianity.”\nQ: “Converted your father?”\nMr Lee: “Yes.\n”\nQ: “Well this happens when you get close to the end.”\nMr Lee: “Well, but I do not know whether my father agreed. At that time he may\nhave been beyond making a rational decision. My brother assumed that he\nagreed and converted him.”\nQ: “But…”\n3\nMr Lee: “I am not converted.”\nQ: next?”\n“But when you reach that stage, you may wonder more than ever what is\nMr Lee: “Well, what is next, I do not know. Nobody has ever come back. The\nMuslims say that there are seventy houris, beautiful women up there. But\nnobody has come back to confirm this.”\nQ: “And you haven‟t converted to Islam, knowing that?”\nMr Lee: “Most unlikely. The Buddhist believes in transmigration of the soul. If\nyou live a good life, the reward is in your next migration, you will be a good being,\nnot an ugly animal. It is a comforting thought, but my wife and I do not believe in\nit. She has been for two years bed-ridden, unable to speak after a series of\nstrokes. I am not going to convert her. I am not going to allow anybody to\nconvert her because I know it will be against what she believed in all her life.\nHow do I comfort myself? Well, I say life is just like that. You can‟t choose how\nyou go unless you are going to take an overdose of sleeping pills, like sodium\namytal. For just over two years, she has been inert in bed, but still cognitive.\nShe understands when I talk to her, which I do every night. She keeps awake for\nme; I tell her about my day‟s work, read her favourite poems.”\nQ: „And what kind of books do you read to her?”\nMr Lee: “So much of my time is reading things online. The latest book which I\nwant to read or re-read is Kim. It is a beautiful of description of India as it was in\nKipling‟s time. And he had an insight into the Indian mind and it is still basically\nthat same society that I find when I visit India. “\n4\nQ: “When you spoke to Time Magazine a couple of years ago, you said Don\nQuixote was your favourite?”\nMr Lee: “Yes, I was just given the book, Don Quixote, a new translation.\n”\nQ: “But people might find that ironic because he was fantasist who did not\nrealistically choose his projects and you are sort of the opposite?”\nMr Lee: “No, no, you must have something fanciful and a flight of fancy. I had a\ncolleague Rajaratnam who read Sci-Fi for his leisure.”‟\nQ: “And you?”:\nMr Lee: “No, I do not believe in Sci-Fi.”\nQ: “But you must have something to fantasise.”\nMr Lee: “Well, at the moment, as I said, I would like to read Kim again. Why I\nthought of Kim was because I have just been through a list of audio books to\nchoose for my wife. Jane Austen, Emily Bronte, books she has on her book shelf.\nSo, I ticked off the ones I think she would find interesting. The one that caught\nmy eye was Kim. She was into literature, from Alice in Wonderland, to\nAdventures with a Looking Glass, to Jane Austen‟s Persuasion, Pride and\nPrejudice, and Sense and Sensibility. Jane Austen was her favourite writer\nbecause she wrote elegant and leisurely English prose of the 19th century. The\nprose flowed beautifully, described the human condition in a graceful way, and\nrolls off the tongue and in the mind. She enjoyed it. Also Chaucer‟s Canterbury\nTales. She was an English Literature major.”\nQ: “You are naming books on the list, not necessarily books you have already\nread, yes?”\n5\nMr Lee: “I would have read some of them.”\nQ: “Like a Jane Austen book, or Canterbury Tales?”\nMr Lee: “No, Canterbury Tales, I had to do it for my second year English\nLiterature course in Raffles College. For a person in the 15th Century, he wrote\nvery modern stuff. I didn‟t find his English all that archaic. I find those Scottish\npoets difficult to read. Sometimes I don‟t make sense of their Scottish brogue.\nMy wife makes sense of them. Then Shakespeare‟s sonnets.”\nQ: “You read those?”\nMr Lee: “I read those sonnets when I did English literature in my freshman‟s\nyear. She read them.”\nQ: “When you say she reads them now, you‟re the one who reads them, yes?”\nMr Lee: “Yes, I read them to her.”\nQ: “But you go to her.”\nMr Lee: “Yes, I read from an Anthology of Poems which she has, and several\nother anthologies. So I know her favourite poems. She had flagged them. I read\nthem to her.”\nQ: “She‟s in the hospital? You go to the hospital?”\nMr Lee: “No, no, she‟s at home. We‟ve got a hospital bed and nurses attending\nto her. We used to share the same room. Now I‟m staying in the next room. I\nhave to get used to her groans and grunts when she‟s uncomfortable from a dry\n6\nthroat and they pump in a spray moisture called “Biothene” which soothes her\nthroat, and they suck out phlegm. Because she can‟t get up, she can‟t breathe\nfully. The phlegm accumulates in the chest but you can‟t suck it out from the\nchest, you‟ve got to wait until she coughs and it goes out to her throat. They\nsuck it out, and she‟s relieved. They sit her up and tap her back. It‟s very\ndistressing, but that‟s life.”\nQ: “Yes, your daughter on Sunday wrote a moving column, movingly about the\nsituation referring to you.”\nMr Lee: “How did you come to read it?”\nQ: “Somebody said you‟ve got to read that column, so I read it.”\nMr Lee: “You don‟t get the Straits Times.”\nQ: “I get it online actually. I certainly do, I follow Singapore online and she wrote\nthat the whole family suffers of course from this and she wrote the one who‟s\nbeen hurting the most and is yet carrying on stoically is my father.”\nMr Lee: “What to do? What else can I do? I can‟t break down. Life has got to\ngo on. I try to busy myself, but from time to time in idle moments, my mind goes\nback to the happy days we were up and about together.”\nQ: “When you go to visit her, is that the time when your mind goes back?”\nMr Lee: “No, not then. My daughter‟s fished out many old photographs for this\npiece she wrote and picked out a dozen or two dozen photographs from the\ndigital copies which somebody had kept at the Singapore Press Holdings. When\nI look at them, I thought how lucky I was. I had 61 years of happiness. We‟ve\ngot to go sometime, so I‟m not sure who‟s going first, whether she or me. So I\n7\ntold her, I‟ve been looking at the marriage vows of the Christians. The best I read\nwas,” To love, to hold and to cherish, in sickness and in health, for better or for\nworse, till death do us part.” I told her I would try and keep you company for as\nlong as I can. She understood.”\nQ: “Yes, it‟s been really.”\nMr Lee: “What to do? What can you do in this situation? I can say get rid of the\nnurses. Then the maids won‟t know how to turn her over and then she gets\npneumonia. That ends the suffering. But human beings being what we are, I do\nthe best for her and the best is to give her a competent nurse who moves her,\nmassages her, turns her over, so no bed sores. I‟ve got a hospital bed with air\ncushions so no bed sores. Well, that‟s life. Make her comfortable.”\nQ: “And for yourself, you feel the weight of age more than you have in the past?”\nMr Lee: “I‟m not sure. I marginally must have. It‟s stress. However, I look at it, I\nmean, it‟s stress. That‟s life. But it‟s a different kind of stress from the kind of\nstress I faced, political stresses. Dire situations for Singapore, dire situations for\nmyself when we broke off from Malaysia, the Malays in Singapore could have\nrioted and gone for me and they suddenly found themselves back as a minority\nbecause the Tunku kicked us out. That‟s different, that‟s intense stress and it‟s\nover but this is stress which goes on. One doctor told me, you may think that\nwhen she‟s gone you‟re relieved but you‟ll be sad when she‟s gone because\nthere‟s still the human being here, there‟s still somebody you talk to and she\nknows what you‟re saying and you‟ll miss that. Well, I don‟t know, I haven‟t come\nto that but I think I‟ll probably will because it‟s now two years, May, June, July,\nAugust, September, two years and four months. It‟s become a part of my life.”\nQ: “She‟s how old now?”\n8\nMr Lee: “She‟s two-and-a-half years older than me, so she‟s coming on to 90.”\nQ: “But you did make a reference in an interview with Time magazine to\nsomething that goes beyond reason as you put it. You referred to the real enemy\nby Pierre D‟Harcourt who talked about people surviving the Nazi, it‟s better that\nthey have something to believe in.”\nMr Lee: “Yes, of course.”\nQ: “And you said that the Communists and the deeply religious fought on and\nsurvived. There are some things in the human spirit that are beyond reason.”\nMr Lee: “I believe that to be true. Look, I saw my friend and cabinet colleague\nwho‟s a deeply religious Catholic. He was Finance Minister, a fine man. In 1983,\nhe had a heart attack. He was in hospital, in ICU, he improved and was taken\nout of ICU. Then he had a second heart attack and I knew it was bad. I went to\nsee him and the priest was giving him the last rites as a Catholic. Absolutely\nfearless, he showed no distress, no fear, the family was around him, his wife and\ndaughters, he had four daughters. With priest delivering the last rites, he knew\nhe was reaching the end. But his mind was clear but absolutely calm.”\nQ: “Well, I am more like you. We don‟t have something to cling to.”\nMr Lee: “That‟s our problem.”\nQ: “But also the way people see you is supremely reasonable person, reason is\nthe ultimate.”\nMr Lee: “Well, that‟s the way I‟ve been working.”\n9\nQ: “Well, you did mention to Tom Plate, they think they know me but they only\nknow the public me?”\nMr Lee: “Yeah, the private view is you have emotions for your close members of\nyour family. We are a close family, not just my sons and my wife and my parents\nbut my brothers and my sister. So my youngest brother, a doctor as I told you,\nhe just sent me an email that my second brother was dying of a bleeding colon,\ndiverticulitis. And later the third brother now has got prostate cancer and has\nspread into his lymph nodes. So I asked what‟re the chances of survival. It‟s not\ngotten to the bones yet, so they‟re doing chemotherapy and if you can prevent it\nfrom going into the bones, he‟ll be okay for a few more years. If it does get to the\nbones, then that‟s the end. I don‟t think my brother knows. But I‟ll probably go\nand see him.”\nQ: “But you yourself have been fit. You have a stent, you had heart problem late\nlast year but besides that do you have ailments?”\nMr Lee: “Well, aches and pains of a geriatric person, joints, muscles but all non-\nterminal. I go in for a physiotherapy, maintenance once a week, they give me a\nrub over because when I cycle, my thighs get sore, knees get a little painful, and\nso the hips.”\nQ: “These are the signs of age.”\nMr Lee: “Yeah, of course.”\nQ: “I‟m 64. I‟m beginning to feel that and I don‟t like it and I don‟t want to admit to\nmyself.”\nMr Lee: “But if you stop exercising, you make it worse. That‟s what my doctors\ntell me, just carry on. When you have these aches and pains, we‟ll give you\n10\nphysiotherapy. I‟ve learnt to use heat pads at home. So after the physiotherapy,\nonce a week, if I feel my thighs are sore, I just have a heat pad there. You put in\nthe microwave oven and you tie it around your thighs or your ankles or your\ncalves. It relieves the pain.”\nQ: “So you continue to cycle.”\nMr Lee: “Oh yeah.”\nQ: “Treadmill?”\nMr Lee: “No, I don‟t do the treadmill. I walk but not always. When I‟ve cycled\nenough I don‟t walk.”\nQ: “That‟s your primary exercise, swimming?”\nMr Lee: “Yeah, I swim everyday, it‟s relaxing.”\nQ: “What other secrets, I see you drink hot water?”\nMr Lee: “Yes.”\nQ: “Tell me about it.”\nMr Lee: “Well, I used to drink tea but tea is a diuretic, but I didn‟t know that. I\nused to drink litres of it. In the 1980s, I was having a conference with Zhou\nZiyang who was then Secretary-General of the Communist Party in the Great\nHall of the People. The Chinese came in and poured more tea and hot water. I\nwas scoffing it down because it kept my throat moistened, my BP was up\nbecause more liquid was in me. Halfway through, I said please stop. I‟m dashing\noff. I had to relief myself. Then my doctors said don‟t you know that tea is a\n11\ndiuretic? I don‟t like coffee, it gives me a sour stomach, so okay, let‟s switch to\nwater.”\nQ: “You know you had the hot water when I met you a couple of years ago and\nafter I told my wife about that, she switched to hot water. She‟s not sure why\nexcept that you drink hot water, so she‟s decided to.”\nMr Lee: “Well, cold water, this was from my ENT man. If you drink cold water,\nyou reduce the temperature of your nasal passages and throat and reduce your\nresistance to coughs and colds. So I take warm water, body temperature. I don‟t\nscald myself with boiling hot water. I avoid that. But my daughter puts blocks of\nice into her coffee and drinks it up. She‟s all right, she‟s only 50-plus.”\nQ: “Let me ask a question about the outside world a little bit. Singapore is a\ngreat success story even though people criticize this and that. When you look\nback, you can be proud of what you‟ve done and I assume you are. Are there\nthings that you regret, things that you wished you could achieve that you\ncouldn‟t?”\nMr Lee: “Well, first I regret having been turfed out of Malaysia. I think if the\nTunku had kept us together, what we did in Singapore, had Malaysia accepted a\nmultiracial base for their society, much of what we‟ve achieved in Singapore\nwould be achieved in Malaysia. But not as much because it‟s a much broader\nbase. We would have improved inter-racial relations and an improved holistic\nsituation. Now we have a very polarized Malaysia, Malays, Chinese and Indians\nin separate schools, living separate lives and not really getting on with one\nanother. You read them. That‟s bad for us as close neighbours.”\nQ: “So at that time, you found yourself with Singapore and you have transformed\nit. And my question would be how do you assess your own satisfaction with what\nyou‟ve achieved? What didn‟t work?”\n12\nMr Lee: “Well, the greatest satisfaction I had was my colleagues and I, were of\nthat generation who were turfed out of Malaysia suffered two years under a racial\npolicy decided that we will go the other way. We will not as a majority squeeze\nthe minority because once we‟re by ourselves, the Chinese become the majority.\nWe made quite sure whatever your race, language or religion, you are an equal\ncitizen and we‟ll drum that into the people and I think our Chinese understand\nand today we have an integrated society. Our Malays are English-educated,\nthey‟re no longer like the Malays in Malaysia and you can see there are some still\nwearing headscarves but very modern looking.”\nQ: “That doesn‟t sound like a regret to me.”\nMr Lee: “No, no, but the regret is there‟s such a narrow base to build this\nenormous edifice, so I‟ve got to tell the next generation, please do not take for\ngranted what‟s been built. If you forget that this is a small island which we are\nbuilt upon and reach a 100 storeys high tower block and may go up to 150 if you\nare wise. But if you believe that it‟s permanent, it will come tumbling down and\nyou will never get a second chance.”\nQ: “I wonder if that is a concern of yours about the next generation. I saw your\ndiscussion with a group of young people before the last election and they were\nsaying what they want is a lot of these values from the West, an open political\nmarketplace and even playing field in all of these things and you said well, if\nthat‟s the way you feel, I‟m very sad.”\nMr Lee: “Because you play it that way, if you have dissension, if you chose the\neasy way to Muslim votes and switch to racial politics, this society is finished.\nThe easiest way to get majority vote is vote for me, we‟re Chinese, they‟re\nIndians, they‟re Malays. Our society will be ripped apart. If you do not have a\ncohesive society, you cannot make progress.”\n13\nQ: “But is that a concern that the younger generation doesn‟t realize as much as\nit should?”\nMr Lee: “I believe they have come to believe that this is a natural state of affairs,\nand they can take liberties with it. They think you can put it on auto-pilot. I know\nthat is never so. We have crafted a set of very intricate rules, no housing blocks\nshall have more than a percentage of so many Chinese, so many percent\nMalays, Indians. All are thoroughly mixed. Willy-nilly, your neighbours are\nIndians, Malays, you go to the same shopping malls, you go to the same schools,\nthe same playing fields, you go up and down the same lifts. We cannot allow\nsegregation.”\nQ: “There are people who think that Singapore may lighten up a little bit when\nyou go, that the rules will become a little looser and if that happens, that might be\nsomething that‟s a concern to you.”\nMr Lee: “No, you can go looser where it‟s not race, language and religion\nbecause those are deeply gut issues and it will surface the moment you start\nplaying on them. It‟s inevitable, but on other areas, policies, right or wrong,\ndisparity of opportunities, rich and poor, well go ahead. But don‟t play race,\nlanguage, religion. We‟ve got here, we‟ve become cohesive, keep it that way.\nWe‟ve not used Chinese as a majority language because it will split the\npopulation. We have English as our working language, it‟s equal for everybody,\nand it‟s given us the progress because we‟re connected to the world. If you want\nto keep your Malay, or your Chinese, or your Tamil, Urdu or whatever, do that as\na second language, not equal to your first language. It‟s up to you, how high a\nstandard you want to achieve.”\nQ: “The public view of you is as a very strict, cerebral, unsentimental. Catherine\nLim, “an authoritarian, no-nonsense manner that has little use for sentiment”.”\n14\nMr Lee: “She‟s a novelist, therefore, she simplifies a person‟s character, make\ngraphic caricature of me. But is anybody that simple or simplistic?”\nQ: “Sentiment though, you don‟t show that very much in public.”\nMr Lee: “Well, that‟s a Chinese ideal. A gentleman in Chinese ideal, the junzi\n(君子) is someone who is always composed and possessed of himself and\ndoesn‟t lose his temper and doesn‟t lose his tongue. That‟s what I try to do,\nexcept when I got turfed out from Malaysia. Then, I just couldn‟t help it.”\nQ: “One aspect of the way you‟ve constructed Singapore is a certain level of fear\nperhaps in the population. You described yourself as a street fighter, knuckle\nduster and so forth.”\nMr Lee: “Yes.”\nQ: “And that produces among some people a level of fear and I want to tell you\nwhat a taxi driver said when I said I was going to interview you. He said, safer\nnot to ask him anything. If you ask him, somebody will follow you. We‟re not in\npolitics so just let him do the politics.”\nMr Lee: “How old is he?‟\nQ: “I‟m sorry, middle aged, I don‟t know.”\nMr Lee: “I go out. I‟m no longer the Prime Minister. I don‟t have to do the difficult\nthings. Everybody wants to shake my hands, everybody wants me to autograph\nsomething. Everybody wants to get around me to take a photo. So it‟s a\nproblem.”\n15\nQ: “Yes but...”\nMr Lee: “Because I‟m no longer in charge, I don‟t have to do the hard things.\nI‟ve laid the foundation and they know that because of that foundation, they‟re\nenjoying this life.‟\nQ: “So when you were the one directly in-charge, you had to be tough, you had\nto be a fighter.”\nMr Lee: “Yes, of course. I had to fight left-wingers, Communists, pro-Communist\ngroups who had killer squads. If I didn‟t have the guts and the gumption to take\nthem on, there wouldn‟t be the Singapore. They would have taken over and it\nwould have collapsed. I also had to fight the Malay Ultras when we were in\nMalaysia for two years.”\nQ: “Well, you don‟t have a lot of dissidents in prison but you‟re known for your\nlibel suits which keeps a lot of people at bay.”\nMr Lee: “We are non-corrupt. We lead modest lives, so it‟s difficult to malign us.\nWhat‟s the easy way to get a leader down? He‟s a hypocrite, he is corrupt, he\npretends to be this when in fact he‟s that. That‟s what they‟re trying to do to me.\nWell, prove it, if what you say is right, then I don‟t deserve this reputation. Why\nmust you say these things without foundation? I‟m taking you to court, you‟ve\nmade these allegations, I‟m open to your cross-examination.”\nQ: “But that may produce what I was talking about, about a level of fear.”\nMr Lee: “No, you‟re fearful of a libel suit? Then don‟t issue these defamatory\nstatements or make them where you have no basis. The Western\ncorrespondent, especially those who hop in and hop out got to find something to\n16\nshow that they are impartial, that they‟re not just taken in by the Singapore\ngrowth story. They say we keep down the opposition, how? Libel suits.\nAbsolute rubbish. We have opponents in Parliament who have attacked us on\npolicy, no libel suits against them and even in Parliament they are privileged to\nmake defamatory allegation and cannot be sued. But they don‟t. They know it is\nnot true.”\nQ: “Let me ask a last question. Again back to Tom Plate, “I’m not serious all the\ntime. Everyone needs to have a good laugh now and then to see the funny side\nof things and to laugh at himself”.”\nMr Lee: “Yes, of course.”\nQ: “How about that?”\nMr Lee: “You have to be that.”\nQ: “So what makes you laugh?”\nMr Lee: “Many things, the absurdity of it, many things in life. Sometimes, I meet\nwitty people, have conversations, they make sharp remarks, I laugh.”\nQ: “And when you laugh at yourself as you said?”\nMr Lee: “That‟s very frequent. Yeah, I‟m reaching 87, trying to keep fit,\npresenting a vigorous figure and it‟s an effort and is it worth the effort? I laugh at\nmyself trying to keep a bold front. It‟s become my habit. I just carry on.”\nQ: “So it‟s the whole broad picture of things that you find funny?”\nMr Lee: “Yes, life as a whole has many abnormalities, of course.”\n17\nQ: “Your public life together with your private life, what you‟ve done over things\npeople write about you and Singapore, that overall is something that you can find\nfunny?”\nMr Lee: “Yes, of course.”\nQ: “You made one of the few people who laugh at Singapore.”\nMr Lee: “Let me give you a Chinese proverb “do not judge a man until you‟ve\nclosed his coffin. Do not judge a man.” Close the coffin, then decide. Then you\nassess him. I may still do something foolish before the lid is closed on me.”\nQ: “So you‟re waiting for the final verdict?”\nMr Lee: “No, the final verdict will not be in the obituaries. The final verdict will be\nwhen the PhD students dig out the archives, read my old papers, assess what\nmy enemies have said, sift the evidence and seek the truth? I‟m not saying that\neverything I did was right, but everything I did was for an honourable purpose. I\nhad to do some nasty things, locking fellows up without trial.”\nQ: “For the greater good?”\nMr Lee: “Well, yes, because otherwise they are running around and causing\nhavoc playing on Chinese language and culture, and accusing me of destroying\nChinese education. You‟ve not been here when the Communists were running\naround. They do not believe in the democratic process. They don‟t believe in\none man, one vote. They believe in one bullet, one vote. They had killer squads.\nBut they at the same time had a united front exploiting the democratic game. It\ngave them cover. But my business, my job was to make sure that they did not\nsucceed. Sometimes you just got to lock the leaders up. They are confusing the\n18\npeople. The reality is that if you allow these people to work up animosity against\nthe government because it‟s keeping down the Chinese language, because\nwe‟ve promoted English, keeping down Chinese culture because you have\nallowed English literature, and we suppress our Chinese values and the Chinese\nlanguage, the Chinese press, well, you will break up the society. They harp on\nthese things when they know they are not true. They know that if you actually do\nin Chinese language and culture, the Chinese will riot and the society must break\nup.”\nQ: “So leadership is a constant battle?”\nMr Lee: “In a multiracial situation like this, it is. Malaysia took the different line;\nMalaysians saw it as a Malay country, all others are lodgers, “orang tumpangan”\n,\nand they the Bumiputras, sons of the soil, run the show. So the Sultans, the\nChief Justice and judges, generals, police commissioner, the whole hierarchy is\nMalay. All the big contracts for Malays. Malay is the language of the schools\nalthough it does not get them into modern knowledge. So the Chinese build and\nfind their own independent schools to teach Chinese, the Tamils create their own\nTamil schools, which do not get them jobs. It‟s a most unhappy situation.”\nMdm Yeong: “I thought that was the last question.”\nQ: “This is the last part of the last question. So your career has been a struggle\nto keep things going in the right way and you‟ve also said that the best way to\nkeep your health is to keep on working. Are you tired of it by this point? Do you\nfeel like you want to rest?”\nMr Lee: “No, I don‟t. I know if I rest I‟ll slide downhill fast. No, my whole being\nhas been stimulated by the daily challenge. If I suddenly drop it all, play golf,\nstroll around, watch the sunset, read novels, that‟s downhill. It is the daily\n19\nchallenge, social contacts, meeting people, people like you, you press me, I\nanswer, when I don‟t…. what have I got tomorrow?”\nMdm Yeong: “You have two more events coming up. One is the Radin Mas\nCommunity.”\nMr Lee: “Oh yeah. I got it.”\nMdm Yeong: “And then you have other call, courtesy call on the 3rd.”\nMr Lee: “We are social animals. Without that interaction with people, you are\nisolated. The worst punishment you can give a person is the isolation ward. You\nget hallucinations. Four walls, no books, no nothing. By way of example, Henry\nKissinger wants to speak to me. So I said okay, we‟ll speak on Sunday. What\nabout? We are meeting in Sao Paolo at a J P Morgan International Advisory\nBoard. He wants to talk to me to check certain facts on China. My mind is kept\nalive, I go to China once a year at least. I meet Chinese leaders. So it‟s a\nconstant stimulus as I keep up to date. Supposing I sit back, I don‟t think about\nChina, just watch videos. I am off to Moscow, Kiev and Paris on the 15th of\nSeptember. Three days Moscow, three days Kiev, four days Paris. Moscow I\nam involved in the Skolkovo Business School which President Medvedev, when\nhe wasn‟t President started. I promised to go if he did not fix it in the winter.\nSo they fix it for September. I look at the fires, I said wow this is no good.”\nQ: “It‟s not going to be freezing if there are fires.”\nMr Lee: “No but our embassy says the skies have cleared. Kiev because the\nPresident has invited me specially and will fly me from Moscow to Kiev and then\nfly me on to Paris. Paris I am on the TOTAL Advisory Board together with Joe\nNye and a few others. They want a presentation on what are China‟s strengths\nand weaknesses. That keeps me alive. It‟s just not my impressionistic views of\n20\nChina but one that has to be backed by facts and figures. So my team works out\nthe facts and figures, and I check to see if they tally with my impressions. But it‟s\na constant stimulus to keep alive, and up-to-date. If I stop it, it‟s downhill.”\nQ: “Well, I hope you continue. Thank you very much, I really enjoyed this\ninterview.”"
