Thank you. Thank you guys very much for coming out. What’s up, y’all beautiful people? This is great, man. You guys can have a seat now. You guys can have a seat. Thank you, thank you so much. Where my Asian people at, Asian people?\n\n[CHEERING]\n\nHey! You came out! We’re out here representing, man. I got to say, it’s been a couple of good years for us Asians, right? We had Crazy Rich Asians last year. That was a huge moment for us, yeah. Jeremy Lin won a championship… for doing nothing. He’s the first Asian kid to receive a participation trophy. We got to be proud of him, finally.\n\nIt’s great, great couple of years, man. But this is recent history. I don’t know if you guys remember this. Just three years ago, there was a movie called The Great Wall— starring Matt Damon. It was a real movie. It was Matt Damon in ancient China fighting dragons and shit, and everybody spoke English? I said, what the fuck is this? But you got to understand. I’m not mad at Matt Damon, OK? He’s an actor. That’s what he does for a living. That’s how he gets a check. I get it. If somebody were to offer me a lead role in a movie called Mount Rushmore,… I would play the shit out of George Washington, you know what I mean?\n\n[CHEERING]\n\nNo shame in my game. I’ll play George Washington Carver if they let me. That’s a black guy, by the way. I don’t know if you know.\n\nGotta represent, man. I see a lot of people out here in the streets, they want to come up to me, but they’re not really sure. There’s a lot of debate amongst their friends. They’re like, hey, man, are you sure that’s him? If we go up there, we got to be sure. Because if we go up there and it’s not him, we’re gonna look super racist. Are you sure that’s not Ken Jeong? I don’t know. It looks kind of like Ali Wong. I don’t know.\n\nAnd they come up to me, it’s always like, the first thing they say, like, hey, hey, man, aren’t you that dude Jian-Yang from that show Silicon Valley? And I’m like, oh, thanks. Thank you. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you. Thank you, I appreciate that. Yeah, I am. And then they’re like, oh, shit, I didn’t even know you speak English in real life! I’m like, it’s called acting, motherfucker. Like, did you really think Matt Damon was Chinese? Like, what’s wrong with you?\n\nI don’t know what the disconnect is. Like, if a white actor does a British accent, he’s a thespian. He wins an Oscar. If I do a Chinese accent, I’m automatically from the old country.\n\nRepresentation matters, man. A lot of Asian people come up to me, very proud, very nice. They’re like, Jimmy, thank you for represent the Asians, man. I’m like, eh, you’re welcome. But you do understand, it’s not really a choice, right? Like, when you wake up Asian, you can only represent Asians. I couldn’t just wake up one day and be like, fuck it, I’m representing Nigerians today.\n\nI’m very proud to represent Asians. But at the same time, there’s so much pressure. Like, nobody ever went up to Matt Damon and be like, hey, Matt, thanks for representing the whites. It sounds weird. That’s like a different conversation for some reason, you know? If somebody came up to me being like, hey, Jimmy, I’m representing for the whites, I would leave that town immediately and never come back.\n\nSo much pressure to represent. I got to be a good Asian everywhere now. I got to tip everywhere I go. That was one of the major advantages of being Asian, is I could just pretend I don’t know how to tip. Y’all know what a Chinese tip is? Chinese tip, it doesn’t matter how big your bill is, you tip $2. That’s a Chi– That’s a Chinese tip, man.\n\nNow I got to tip 20% everywhere. I got to give every Uber driver five-star ratings just so I can be a good representative.\n\nEverywhere I go, I got to represent. Even day to day shit, even the bedroom I got to represent. After I hooked up with this one girl, this is what she said to me. She was like, Jimmy, I don’t know how to tell you this, but you’re the first Asian guy I’ve ever been with. I’m like, OK. What do you want, a fortune cookie? Like, wha–? Like, what do you want? She acted like she just unlocked a new character on Street Fighter or some shit. Why do you feel the need to say that?\n\nThis one girl said this shit that was so disrespectful. This is what she said to me after we hooked up. She was like, Jimmy, um, I’m just glad the stereotype’s not true. You don’t have a small penis. I’m like, bitch, you understand you just insulted my entire race of people? But thank you. First of all, thank you for thinking that I did have a small penis, and we still had sex. You’re the real MVP. You get two fortune cookies tonight, miss. Thank you.\n\nBut that’s a fucked up stereotype, right? That’s not even true. That’s a fucked up stereotype. Everybody should have average dick until proven guilty. I don’t care how tall you are, what ethnicity you are, how big your hands are. Everybody should start at average dick, 8 inches. And we go from there.\n\nThere’s so much pressure, man. I feel like every time I have sex, there’s a billion Chinese people on my back just judging me. I gotta make sure I perform and represent, you know? I got to get them an extra pump for my uncle in Shanghai, an extra pump for my nephew in Hong Kong and shit. It’s like, oh, my god. That’s why you see old Asian people, they be walking like this, just like– (CHINESE ACCENT) It’s so much pressure.\n\nI love old Asian people, man. Yeah, yeah, old Asian people are the best. But why are all old Asian people always stretching in the park? Like, it doesn’t matter which city you’re in, which park you go to, you wake up, 6:30 in the morning, you see about 250 old Asian people all doing this shit at the same time, for like three hours. What the fuck are they doing? And my dad was trying to explain to me. He’s like, oh, they’re warming up to do Tai Chi. I’m like, for how long? And ironically, Tai Chi is a warm-up in itself. So they’re warming up to warm up for nothing. And I think to a lot of Americans, like, people think that Tai Chi to some, like, exotic Chinese secret, some oriental art. No. Tai Chi is just exercise for people who are too old to exercise. Let’s not exoticize these things, you know?\n\nIt’s actually super simple to do Tai Chi. I went to a park, watched those old people for like an hour, and I learned how to do Tai Chi. Very simple, all you gotta do is two things. All you gotta do to do to Tai Chi is pretend you’re wiping down a window and getting a blow job at the same time. You guys seem skeptical. Allow me to demonstrate.\n\n[CHEERING]\n\nIt’s very simple. All you gotta do, you get it your little stance, right, OK? And then you wipe down a window. And now you get a blow job. Then you lift her head up, because you’re a gentleman, you know? That’s Tai Chi.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nThank you, thank you. Let’s not exoticize these Asian things. They’re just old people reminiscing about the days when they got sucked off. That’s it.\n\nYou got to take advantages of all these, like, Asian stereotypes, you know? If people are just going to exoticize us, that’s fine. Whenever somebody asks me to do something I don’t want to do, I just make up a fake Chinese holiday now. It’s like, hey, Jimmy can you help me move next Monday? I’m like, Monday? That’s the Dragon Boat Lychee Boba Festiva, dog. I can’t– I can’t just help you move. My grandfather died for that shit, you understand?\n\nAnd if people are just gonna assume that I don’t speak English, that’s fine. That’s what I do now when I get pulled over by the cops. I just pretend I don’t speak English. I haven’t gotten a ticket in five years. Last time I got pulled over, the cop was knocking on my window. He was like, sir, you do understand you can’t make a right turn here? It says right there on the sign. You can’t make a right turn. So I just looked up at him. I was like, (CHINESE ACCENT) Oh, I don’t know. I’m sorry, but-ah English not very good. So I cannot read-ah the sign. And he was really confused. He just looked back down at me. He was like, sir, the sign is not in English. It’s a diagram, so I don’t understand how that’s a language barrier? So I just looked up at him. I was like, (CHINESE ACCENT) Oh… I don’t know. But do you know today is the Dragon Boat Lychee Boba–\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nYou got to use it to your advantage, people. I’m very happy to be here, man.\n\n[CHEERING]\n\nThank you. Oh, you guys don’t have to– thank you. Thank you for all your support. It’s been great. It’s been really great. Like, I’m finally– I’m like quasi-famous now. Nothing’s really changed. I might get a free appetizer at select PF Chang’s. That’s about it. Nothing’s really changed. I was still using Tinder up until like a year ago. This is a true story. But now I realize I got a whole new set of issues on Tinder. Like now, when I do match with a girl, she doesn’t believe that it’s me. Like, ew, that’s not you. You’re not that guy from this thing and that thing. I’m like, who the fuck is using me as a fake profile? You gotta dig real deep to use me, man. I feel like there’s so many better choices out there.\n\nOne time– one time, my agent told me that I had a good look. And I’m like, thanks, dude, I appreciate that. But then it took me years to realize that having a good look is totally different than being good-looking. I still don’t know what the fuck it means.\n\nAnd look, I’m not being self-deprecating, OK? That’s Hollywood talk. I don’t listen to that shit. I understand that, in real life, I’m like super good-looking– if you’re into anime. You gotta get in where you fit in, people. One time, I went over to the girl’s house, she has this, like, Naruto anime poster in her bedroom. I knew I was fucking that night. You got to know your demo, people. Asian people, we don’t need Tinder anymore. We just go to BTS concerts. That’s how we do that parking lot pimping.\n\nI’ve been dating a lot of tall girls lately, because it makes me look successful. No, no. I think tall women are beautiful. But some of them like to wear heels. That’s just disrespect. Like, you’re already five inches taller than me. Why the fuck are you wearing heels? She’s like, it makes my ass look better. I’m like, your ass is at my eye level right now. Neither of us look good, OK? I look like a child, and you look like a child molester.\n\nLast time– the last time I took a tall girl to this concert– I don’t know if you guys know this, but apparently, tall people have fun at concerts. Are you guys aware of that? I’m 5′ 5″. I just go to concerts to smell other people’s armpits. I’m like what the fuck’s the point of this? She was having the time of her life, doing whatever tall people do at concerts, you know, jumping around, obstructing other people’s views, seeing everything. I was frustrated. I had enough. So I just looked up at her, I was like, hey! Pick me up. This is bullshit. I paid for these tickets, OK? I want to see Billy Eilish, too. Come on.\n\nI know I’m becoming an adult finally, because now my favorite TV show is Fixer Upper on HGTV. That’s the greatest show of all time. You guys watch it, Chip and Joanna Gaines, Fixer Upper? It’s a great show, right? It’s a great show. Like, it’s really a beautiful relationship. Joanna does all the interior decorating, and she brings in all the furniture and makes the house look amazing. And Chip just hires Mexicans to do everything for him. It’s the most symbiotic American relationship ever.\n\nAnd it’s a really nice show. It’s a feel-good show. It’s an aspiring show. You watch the show and you’re like, man, one day, maybe my house could look that nice– if I moved to Waco, Texas. If I just give up on my life and move to Waco, Texas, maybe I can have a new open concept kitchen.\n\nI don’t know about you guys. Shit is expensive where I live in LA. And I watch this show and I just get frustrated. Because you get, like, these like, entry-level-job-having people in Texas. And they’re like, Joanna, we’re looking for a six bedroom house on three acres of land and our budget’s $50,000. Bitch, I can’t even buy a crack house in Compton for $50,000.\n\nHGTV is just basically “MTV Cribs” for adults. Because when you were 15, you had crazier dreams, you know? You watch “MTV Cribs,” and you’re like, oh, man, one day, I hope I can have a Lamborghini. One day, I hope I can have a fridge with only Gatorades. And now, you’re like 35, your dreams just get a little more realistic. You’re watching HGTV, and you’re just, like, oh, man, one day, I wish I could just fix this roof.\n\nLook, I’m doing, like, fine by any measure, you know? But I still live in a one-bedroom apartment because that shit is rent-controlled. And when the Asian people, when we find a good deal, we’re never letting that shit go. -Yeah.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nThat apartment is about to be generational. It’s gonna get passed to my nephew, his kids, and all that. It’s mine now, basically. I don’t want to buy a house. I live by myself, and I’m scared of ghosts. I’ve seen enough movies to know that ghosts only haunt houses, not one bedroom apartments.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nYeah. I’ve seen enough Hollywood movies to know that ghost only haunt rich people’s houses in the suburbs, preferably with a newborn baby, because they got way too much to lose. Shit is high stakes. I live by myself. I ain’t got nothing to lose. A ghost come haunt me, I just move. Worse comes to worse, I lose my security deposit. Fuck it, you know? What’s a ghost gonna do? He’s gonna follow me from unit to unit, start knocking on my light fixtures and shit. I’m like, hey, dog, go ahead. It’s not even mine. You fuck around, we both get evicted, OK? Like, you don’t want to be a homeless ghost.\n\nAnd if you really think about it, what kind of loser ghost haunts an apartment? That means that ghost probably died in an apartment. He didn’t even die a homeowner. I ain’t got no respect for that shit. He comes haunt me, I just start talking shit to him. Like, hey, dog, what was your credit score when you died, though, like, for real? For real.\n\nI was born in Hong Kong. Any Hong Kong people? A couple of us– awesome, man. For you guys that haven’t been following the news, Hong Kong is a part of Japan. I’m joking, obviously. But I said the same shit in Kansas City, and people were like, really? Wow, we learned something new today, Bill.\n\nI did a show in Kansas City. I don’t know why either. People are very nice in Kansas City. I’m not gonna say, like, they’re racist or anything like that, but they’re just, like, curious. Like they’re watching me like they’re watching an episode of National Geographic. And a pack of giraffes just ran by, and they’re like, oh, I’ve never seen one of those in real life. It looks majestic.\n\nThis one kid in Kansas City came up to me after the show, very nice kid. This is what he said. He was like, ah, Jimmy, thought you were really funny, man. I don’t mean to offend you– that’s when you know you’re about to get offended. He was like, I don’t mean to offend you, but when I first saw your poster, I thought you were gonna play the violin. I was like, I do, motherfucker, just not right now. Shit.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nI keep it a secret.\n\nSee, I gotta say, I got some of the nicest crowds in the business. I rarely ever get heckled. And one time I was talking about how I used to play the violin. An old Chinese lady sitting in the front, just stood up and screamed out, first chair or second chair?\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nAnd I was like, thanks, ma’am, fifth chair, actually, fifth chair. I wasn’t– I wasn’t very good. I wasn’t good.\n\nI grew up very stereotypically in Hong Kong. Like my real name is not even Jimmy. That’s my English name. My real name is Man-Sing. In Cantonese, [SPEAKING CANTONESE]. It stands for 10,000 success. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. I had very ambitious parents. And now I’m telling dick jokes and doing Tai Chi on stage, so–\n\nJimmy was just kind of like an arbitrary English name that just sounded easy. And my dad, he named himself Richard. I was like, Dad, why’d you name yourself Richard? He was like, because I want to be rich. It makes so much sense.\n\nAnd then they named my older brother Roger after the James Bond actor Roger Moore. Yeah, but my brother hated that name. He was like, man, it makes me sound like an old white guy. So eventually he changed his own name to Roy. So now he sounds like an older white guy. And now his full name is Roy Roger, which is the oldest white guy to ever white.\n\nI grew up very stereotypically, man. I didn’t play basketball or football. I grew up playing ping pong— competitively! That was a serious national sport back home, man. You know, I didn’t go to any, like, fun summer camp, space camp. My dad sent me to a ping pong training camp in Gwangju, China. I almost died. It was 100 kids competing for one spot on the national team. It was basically Fortnite with ping pong paddles.\n\nWe took that shit seriously, though. My dad would take me to every practice, every tournament game. And he always tried to give me a pep talk before every game. But you know, Asian parents, they’re way too honest. So every pep talk just turned into an insult. Like, he would come up to me, be like, (CHINESE ACCENT) Jimmy. Jimmy. You’re going to play well, OK? Even though you slow, even though you weak, and you suck. And then he would just walk away.\n\nI was very good at math. That’s a big Asian stereotype. I think there’s some truth to that. Not because of some weird genetic thing, just because our parents cared so much more about mathematics and academics. You guys seen it. You guys seen those, like, Kumon Learning Centers in those strip malls, right, right? Kumon Learning Centers, for you guys that don’t know, are basically detention camps for young Asian children. You can tell that place is kind of fucked up by the look of its logo. Because it’s supposed to be a smiley face, but it’s not really smiling. It’s just like, meh.\n\nMy parents were way too cheap to send me to Kumon. They got a different strategy. They never let me use a calculator until I turned 15, so I can work on my brain function. That’s an old school Chinese strategy. So when I turned 15, it was a very special occasion. It was basically my Quinceañera. My dad just gave me a TI-83 Plus.\n\n[CHEERING]\n\nAnd he looked me in the eyes, and he was like, you’re a woman now, OK?\n\nBut when you’re a kid, when your parents tell you you can’t do something, what do you do? You rebel, right? So when I was 14 years old, I stole my brother’s calculator. I stole Roy Rogers calculator, and I locked myself in my room. And I started rebelling. I started doing math homework. Other kids were, like, fucking around with, like, alcohol and drugs. I was fucking up some parabolas, you know? Locked myself in a room, I was just punching in numbers. I was like, oh, man, this feels great, you know? It’s so wrong. It’s awesome.\n\nMy dad was pissed. He was knocking on the outside of the door. He doesn’t like locked doors in the house. And he was screaming. He was like, (CHINESE ACCENT) Jimmy! Jimmy! What are you doing inside? Come out right now. I know you’re in there using a calculator. Come out right now. I was so scared I didn’t know what to do. And he unlocked the door, and he came in. I went into full panic mode. So I just threw away the calculator, and I pulled down my pants. I was like, Dad, I was just jerking off. And he came in, and he looked at me. And then he looked at the math homework. And he was like good, good, very good. Very good, very good, you must really like math. That’s good. Keep it up. Because there is nothing, there is nothing that will make an Asian father more proud than to see his son jerk off to his math homework.\n\nI grew up very stereotypically, man. But all these things– playing the violin, being good at math, my names– those things weren’t stereotypes when I was growing up in Hong Kong, because everybody was Asian. Everyone was good at math. It didn’t become a stereotype until I came to this country when I was 13 years old. And I automatically became the weird foreign kid. Like, I didn’t really even know how to speak English. I learned English how you guys will learn Spanish, just on paper. But if I would have dropped you off in Mexico when you’re 13 years old, you would’ve died.\n\nI was a very confused kid, man. The first day of school, everybody was standing up, putting their right hand on their chest, doing the Pledge of Allegiance. I didn’t know what was going on. I was like, did, I just join a cult? First day of school, this girl came up to me. She was like, hey, what’s up? I didn’t know what that meant, so I just looked up.\n\nI was a very confused kid. All these little customs, I wasn’t used to. Like the first day of PE class, first day of PE class, we had to change into our gym clothes. I’d never done that. Everybody was wearing boxers, and I was still wearing tighty-whiteys. And this kid, this bully next to me, he was being real mean. He was like, hey, look, the Asian kid’s wearing tighty-whiteys. That’s gay. And I was like, oh, really, is I what it means? I had no idea. And then I put on my gym shorts, but my mom had bought me gym shorts that was my exact size, an extra small. So that wasn’t very cool, because it came down mid-thigh. And apparently back in the day, that was called a John Stockton. And the same kid next to me, that bully next to me, he was like, hey, hey, look at– don’t wear your pants like that. Pull your pants down, man. Pull your pants down. And I was like, who’s the gay one now? But I didn’t know what to do. Everybody was looking at me, and this kid kept saying pull your pants down. So I was like, oh, shit. I’ve seen Shawshank Redemption. Maybe this is just how it works in America. So I start pulling down my shorts all the way down to my knees, all the way down to my ankle. And that same kid, the bully next to me, is like, hey, what are you doing? Don’t pull them down all the way. That’s gay. And I’m like, what is not gay in this country? And apparently this other kid next me, he’s like, hey, don’t pull them down all the way. Just sag them a little bit. Just sag your pants. And I didn’t know what sagging your pants meant. Apparently, that’s a cool, hip hop thing, to pull your pants down halfway down your butt so you show everybody you asshole. And apparently, that’s the only not gay way to wear your pants in America.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nI had no idea. All these weird American things I wasn’t used to. Eventually, I learned how to speak English by watching a lot of TV, mainly BET Rap City. Because that was my shit. I want to be cool, and nothing cooler than BET Rap City, right? Every music video was a slice of somebody’s American dream. The first music video I saw was Jay-Z’s “Big Pimpin'”. You guys remember that shit? Jay-Z’s “Big Pimpin'” was the greatest music video of all time. It was Jay-Z and his boys on a yacht pouring champagne on this beautiful woman’s face for, like, four minutes. I was like, this is America? It’s amazing.\n\nThat’s all I wanted to do. Like before I even wanted to get into stand-up, that’s all I want to do. I want to be a rapper. I want to be like Jay-z in “Big Pimpin'”. So I started my own rap group in high school. This is a true story. It was me, my black friend Julian, and my other friend Yugi, who was half black and half Japanese. So we are perfectly 1 and 1/2 black dudes and 1 and 1/2 Asian dudes. And we called ourselves The Yellow Panthers. I know. I wish I was making this shit up, but I’m not. The Yellow Panthers was a real rap group. And we had a real rap song. It was called, “Underground Railroad Builder.”\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nI was confused. Eventually, I became a good Asian-American, and I went to school to get an Economics degree. Because that was the easiest degree that can still appease my Asian parents. But then after I graduated, I didn’t want to do, like, econ or finance. So I went up to my dad, I was like, dad, I don’t want to do any of this. I want to go try and do stand-up. He was like, what’s a– what’s a stand-up? You mean like a talk show? I was like, yeah, sure, talk show, whatever you want to call it. But I want to go pursue my dreams. And he was like, no. Pursue your dreams how you become homeless. I was like, no, no, Dad, Dad, it’s– things are different now. We’re in America, OK? In America, we’re supposed to do what we love. He was like, no. Everyone does what they hate for money and use the money to do what they love.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nThat’s that old school Chinese mentality, right? See, I’m like first generation. But my parents, they’re like negative 9 generation, because they’re so frickin’ Chinese. Like, it’s really hard for me to watch TV with my dad, because he’s trying to make me explain everything to him. First of all, old Asian people, they don’t watch TV. They judge the TV. This is like, I’m just sitting next to my dad on the couch, and he’s wearing his, like, old Asian man costume, which is just a wife beater and tighty-whiteys. He’s just sitting there, arms folded, judging the TV like–\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\n[GRUNTS] [COUGHS] He’s made some random noises around the house. Now whenever he sneezes, it’s never just a sneeze. It’s like a whole tsunami of sound waves that comes after. It’s just like, achoo! Oh! Ay, shit.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nOh! I’m like, what the fuck, Dad, just have an orgasm? What was that?\n\nAnd he doesn’t understand what I’m saying half the time. He’s like, oh, there’s an orgasm. OK, the orga– orgasm.\n\nAnd he’s trying to make me explain everything to him on TV. Do you understand how difficult it is to explain a rap music video to an old Chinese man? We’re just sitting there. My dad was like, uh, Jimmy, Jimmy, what it mean when he say Lamborghini Mercier? What’s that? And I’m like, Dad, he’s bragging about his car. It’s a Lamborghini Mercier Largo, a very expensive car. You know what that is, right? And he was like, oh, OK, OK, yes, yes. That’s when you know they have no idea what the fuck you just said. He was like, OK, OK, yes, yes, a Lamborghini, OK.\n\nJimmy, what he mean when he say, your chick, she so thirsty. What’s that? And I was like, shit, um– Dad, he’s making fun of somebody’s girlfriend, OK? It’s saying, like, she likes attention from other guys, and she likes to do sex stuff with them, you know, like, blow jobs and such. And he was like, oh, OK, OK, yes, yes. Yes, blow jobs, OK. Mm. [CLEARS THROAT] Jimmy, Jimmy. I’m thirsty, too, OK? So– I was like, oh, god, no. No, it got lost in translation. It’s disgusting.\n\nI don’t know if you guys know this, but I came from an acting family. But it’s not really like Angelina Jolie and Jon Voight. I guess I would be Angelina Jolie in that equation. My dad is also an actor, but he started acting after I did. Because he was like, it’s so easy, you can do it, I can. I’m like, Dad, fine, if you think my life’s so easy, why don’t you go to some open call auditions and you’ll understand how hard it is, how much rejection I face every day at my job. He was like, OK. And he went to all these auditions, and he started booking everything. It’s a true story. He got on this show in China, in mainland China, called “Little Daddy,” “Xiao Baba.” Half a billion people watch that show. It’s like the Big Bang Theory of China, and Richard blew up. And he was like, this is easy. I don’t know.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nMy plan completely backfired. And my aunt in Shanghai, she watched the show, and she will call the house in LA. And she’s like, congratulations, Richard, you’re such a good actor. Did your son teach you how to act? And he’s like, no, no, I’m a natural. Oh, that’s very good, you and your son, same busyness, you know? You two are very funny. He’s like, no, no, Jimmy is not funny. I’m like, Dad that’s bullshit, OK? You got one good role, good for you. I’m happy for you. But you’re not a real actor yet. Real actors, we got to cry, we got to laugh. Do you even know how to cry in front of a camera? He was like, yes, I just think about how much you suck at ping pong.\n\nNeedless to say, I grew up with low self-esteem, because I was raised by Asian parents. My dad’s not even the worse. My mom’s much worse. Have you guys ever hung out with old Asian ladies? Old Asian ladies will tell you exactly what the fuck is wrong with your face, as if they’re trying to do you a favor. I go to my mom’s house, the first thing she says, she’s like, Jimmy…\n\n[MANDARIN] Ai-yah.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nWhy is your face so fat? Your clothes look homeless. And your hair, ai-yah, it’s gay.\n\nSometimes it’s like embarrassing for me to hang out with my mom, you know? Because Asian people, we just got a different custom, you know? Like my mom, when she goes shopping, she doesn’t buy shit she needs. She just buys shit because it’s a good deal. I brought– one time, I brought a full price shirt home, $20. And she was like, was it full price? No, it’s a bad deal. I was like, Mom, it’s only 20 bucks. She’s like, yes, $20, if you’re stupid. She goes to Ross and she freaks out, because everything’s a great deal. She’s like, Jimmy, you should buy this. You should buy– this is a good deal. This is a good deal. I’m like Mom, that’s a double XL shirt, OK? And it says Obey on it. I’m not gonna fucking wear that. And she’s like, it’s OK, 50% off. Some day it’ll fit, OK?\n\nIf you want a good deal, you follow the old Asian people, right? You go to Costco, you see a sea of old Asian people, because you know everyone’s getting a great deal. Nobody’s getting ripped off. You go to Whole Foods, never seen one old Asian motherfucker in my life.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nWe don’t believe in that shit. Look, there’s nothing wrong with Whole Foods. Matter of fact, it’s too nice. And Asian people, we don’t like to pay for atmosphere. Have you guys been to a Chinese grocery store? It’s a fucking zoo. You walk in there, there’s just a frog jumping from one aisle to the other. There’s a piece of fish still flopping around on the floor. Half the place place is an aquarium. I don’t know why you ever pay for kids to go to SeaWorld when you just take them to the Ranch 99 for free.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nThat’s a good deal. That’s a great deal.\n\nAsian people, we don’t buy organic shit. We don’t believe in organic labeling. We better still see it swimming or still walking. That’s organic to us. That’s the only way we know.\n\nAll my friends in LA, all my hipster friends, they’re like, Jimmy, you gotta eat organic, man. This regular stuff you eat, they have growth hormones in them. It’s gonna fucking kill you. I’m like, really, growth hormones? Wait a minute. You’re trying to tell me I’ve been eating growth hormones all my life, and I’m still 5′ 5″ and I shop at Gap Kids? Get the fuck out of here. I’ll pay extra for growth hormones. Get me to the GMO only section, you know?\n\nAll this organic stuff in America is getting out of control. It’s not just organic food. You got like organic bed sheets, organic hand soap. I don’t know about you guys, but growing up in my very Chinese family, hand soap wasn’t even a thing. Hand soap used to be that piece of crap leftover soap that my dad’s been washing his balls with for two months. And he just puts it on the soap counter. You walk by, you rub your two fingers on it for good luck. That was– that was hand soap. Nobody got sick. It was fine. Once in a while, you got a piece of pubes. So what? You deal with it.\n\nNow hand soap is so fancy, it’s got its own aisle at the grocery stores. Because it’s not about washing your hands anymore. It’s a status symbol. We go to our friends’ house and judge how well they’re doing but what kind of hand soap you got. We’ve all done this. You go to your friend’s house, he’s got that green bar soap that says Zest on it. That guy’s a fucking peasant. Don’t associate yourself with that kind of animal. He’s gonna ask you for money, you know what I mean? And then next level up, you got like the $2 bottle of Softsoap with the fish or the watermelon on it, you know? I like that family. That’s the backbone of America. It’s the middle class Honda Civics of soaps.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nHardworking, American family, man, I appreciate that. And then next level up, you got a soap that’s so fancy it doesn’t even dispense soap. It dispenses foam, which is just soap filled with air for an extra $6 a fucking bottle. Because as an American society, we decided we’re way too good to rub our own two hands together to create our own foam, and rather outsource that foaming action to some poor Chinese kid in Gwangju, China to pre-foam it for us. Make America foam again, people, OK.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nThank you. My mom eventually caved in and she bought the $2 bottle of Softsoap with the fish on it. But she’s so Chinese, she’s been watering it down for six years now. And now it’s just a bottle water with a fish on it. It doesn’t do shit. Because it’s a good deal.\n\nI know I make fun of my parents, but at the end of they day, I love them very much. I think we all do, right? But Asian people, we don’t ever say I love you to each other. That’s just not our thing. One time, I got high and I called my mom. I was like, Mom, I just– I just want to tell you, Mom, I love you. And you can hear her start, like, crying on the other side of the line. She was like, oh, Jimmy, do you have cancer?\n\nWe just got different ways of showing love. Like when I see my grandmother, I don’t give her a hug. I just give her a solid handshake. We’re not about that hugging. And Asian grandmas, they’re the best. You give her a handshake, she’s like a vending machine. You give her a handshake, out comes a red envelope.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nAnd you gotta pretend you don’t want that shit. You’re like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, please, please. OK, thank you.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nThat’s just how we show love.\n\nMy dad still calls me like 20 times a day just to check up on me. It’s annoying, but I understand that’s how he shows love. I was talking to my friend here, and he was like, oh, I haven’t talked to my dad in three weeks. I’m like, what, is he in jail? He was like, no, I live with him. I just haven’t talked to him in three weeks. I’m like, you do understand, if I don’t call my dad back in three hours, he’s going to call 911. 911, what’s your emergency? My son is dead! It’s like, sir, is everything OK? Is your son dead? He’s like, no, but he’s dead to me. OK, bye.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nThat’s just how we love.\n\nMy parents, they’ve been married for 38 years. Yeah, 38 years. It’s beautiful, man. It’s beautiful, 38 years. One time I asked my dad, I was like, Dad, after 38 years, do you still love Mom? And he was like, (LAUGHING) love? Your mom married me to escape communist China. It’s not love. It’s a good deal.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nThat’s how we show love, people.\n\n[SIGHS] I’ve been in this country for almost 20 years now. I think I feel every bit American. But I think other people still don’t see that. As an Asian-American, a lot of times, people see you as Asian before they ever see you as American. Even still till today, whenever I tell people I’m from Hong Kong, this is always the first thing they say. They’re like, oh, yeah, you from Hong Kong? Yeah, yeah, dude, from Hong Kong, yeah? Ni Hao. I’m always like– Like, do think that’s impressive or something? I don’t understand the mindset behind that. You coming up to me to say, ni hao, it’s like me coming to you guys after the show, I’m like, oh, you guys from here? Yeah, y’all from here? Hi. It’s not impressive. It’s annoying. It’s stupid.\n\nI don’t even like going to Chinese restaurants with some of my friends anymore. Because this is what they do to me every time. They’re like, Jimmy, do you speak Chinese? Do you speak Chinese? Yeah, yeah, order Chinese, bro. They’re gonna hook it up. Order in Chinese. Bro, bro, order in Chinese, bro. I’m like, bro, we’re at Panda Express.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nShe’s Mexican. Like, what–? Her name tag says Consuela. That’s not Mandarin or Cantonese.\n\nNothing has really changed, you know? Like about 10 years ago, I went on a college trip to Tijuana, Mexico. Because that’s just what a good American college student would do. And the thing is, walking into Mexico from the US, they don’t check anything. They’re just a big revolving door. You walk right in. They don’t even check your ID. It’s easier to get into Mexico than a Costco. You just walk in. And that’s it. But coming back was a totally different story. Coming back from Mexico to the US, there’s no more revolving doors. Now it’s a concrete windowless tunnel with guards with M-16 machine guns. And I was super nervous, being an immigrant and all. And my college buddy, Ian, next to me, he was like, Jimmy, don’t worry, man. Just tell him that you’re American. They let you right through. I’m like, easy for you to say, Ian. Ian walks up, he gets through, no problem. I walk up, the first thing they ask me, they’re like, sir, are you an American citizen? I was like, yes. But I forgot one very minor detail– that I wasn’t. I was still an immigrant on a green card, and I wasn’t a full-on citizen yet. Next thing you know, I was detained in this 10 by 10 box, and they started interrogating me. They’re like, sir, why did you lie about your American citizenship? I was like, I’m so sorry. I’m drunk and I really wasn’t trying to lie. My friend in front of me told me to tell you I was American, so that’s just what I did. It was a knee-jerk reaction. He was like, well, was he American? I was like, well, his name is Ian, so probably. And then the officer was like, sir, you do understand this is a very serious offense. We could deport you for this. I was like, deport me? I didn’t even know that was an option. What was I going to do back in Hong Kong, restart my ping pong career? That ship has sailed, man. So I was like, sir, please, please, don’t deport me. I’m just a drunk, stupid college. I’m every bit American. I can recite you every single Jay-Z lyric if you want me to. I’m in three fantasy football leagues. If that’s not American, I don’t know what is.\n\nAnd I got very lucky. This is what he said. He was like, look, kid, you got lucky. We’re not gonna deport you today, OK? But just don’t ever do that again, or we’ll send you back to where you came from. And this motherfucker was Asian. I was like, where I came from? We came from the same place, dog? I think I saw you at my uncle’s wedding two years ago. Why you gonna throw me under the bus? That guy definitely watched The Great Wall many times.\n\nBut that was a very sobering experience. I had been in the country for 10 years at that point, but I still wasn’t American. Nothing has changed. I finally got my citizenship three years ago. And it’s–\n\n[CHEERING]\n\nYou don’t have to clap. My point is, nothing has changed. Still Asian. Just because I got a new passport, nobody in any part of the world is gonna come up to me and be like, hey, look, there’s an American! Holy shit, look at him. He looks just like Rocky Balboa.\n\nOh, my god. No, no, no. The first day I got my passport, I was feeling real patriotic. So I went to my local Hooters. Yeah, I was drinking a Coors Light. I was watching a World Cup. It was USA versus Mexico. And I was like, man, I’m cheering for Team USA. I’m American, finally! And this old Mexican dude came up to me. He couldn’t really speak English, and this is what he said. He was like, amigo! Amigo, Mexico, Korea, tomorrow, huh? And I’m like, what the fuck are you talking about? What, are you trying to start World War 3 or something? I’m not a Korean. He managed to insult me with the only three English words he knew.\n\nSo I really felt the need to explain myself. I was like, sir, I’m not– I’m not Korean. I’m Chinese. And he looked back to his friends, he was like, oh, [SPEAKING SPANISH], huh? And I’m like, sir, you do know that I can understand what that means, OK? I have Mexican friends back home just like you. He was like, no, I’m not Mexican. I’m El Salvador. And I’m like, oh, great, now I’m the fucking racist!\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nNothing has changed. The first time I used my American passport, I was feeling real good. I was going to Winnipeg, Canada to do some shows. Have you guys even been to Winnipeg?\n\n[CHEERING]\n\nOh, you, really? Are you guys from Winnipeg? No, just general Canadian pride, I appreciate that. I don’t think anybody in their right mind would go to Winnipeg. Not that– there’s nothing wrong with that city. It’s way too cold and it’s just not that fun. I had to go there for some work, so whatever. But I felt good. I walked through the border. I was holding my blue passport, and I slammed it down in front of the Canadian border patrol. I’m like, I’m American, sir. And he’s like, OK. I didn’t ask you that, but OK. Are you here for business or pleasure? And I was like, shit, I didn’t think that far. I was obviously there for business, but I didn’t get a business visa. So I looked him in the eyes. I was like, sir, I’m here for pleasure. And he looked right back at me. He was like, are you sure? Because nobody comes to Winnipeg for pleasure. The next thing you know, I was detained in this 10 by 10 box. Nothing has changed.\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nI was hanging out with Julian not too long ago, 1/3 of The Yellow Panthers. We were just in LA on Melrose getting some brunch. And that’s how you know two minorities had made it– avocado toasts. We’re just chilling, minding our own business, right? And this old man came up to us, old guy. He’s wearing a hat that said, Vietnam and Korea War vet. I was like, damn, this guy really hates Asian people. Like, he survived us twice. I better be careful. But he was actually a really nice guy. He was a really nice guy, complete stranger. And he came up to me and Julian. He was like, guys, what you guys are doing right now, it’s exactly the Civil Rights that I fought for in the ’60s. Keep it up. And he just walked away. I was like, what the fuck? I didn’t know there was a Civil Rights march for avocado toast. I was unaware. And Julian was like, no, no, no, no, no, he’s trying to say that he fought for the right for an Asian man and a black man to hang out in public with no judgment. That’s beautiful, right? I was like, no, he didn’t. Jackie Chan fought for that shit in Rush Hour 1, 2, and 3, OK?\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nBecause representation matters. That’s how we do change. I just want to see more Asian people out there doing their thing. Don’t listen to your Asian parents. Go pursue your dreams, you know what I mean? Go do your thing, man. I just want to see more Asian brothers and sisters on TV. Like look, there’s nothing more American than NFL Sunday, than football Sunday. But you don’t ever see one Asian person. You don’t see one Asian person in the NFL. I mean, we got that kicker, Younghoe Koo, you know? But he gets cut every two weeks. So that doesn’t– I can’t go buy a new Younghoe Koo jersey every two weeks, you know what I mean?\n\nBut what frustrates me, it’s even in the commercials. Even in all the football commercials, you never see one Asian person. Like all these great beer commercials, you got everyone. You got like, even like dumb commercials with, like, a white guy climbing a Rocky Mountain for Coors Light. It’s not even a good commercial. They don’t even sell you on how good the beer is. They sell you on how cold it is. It’s like brewed cold, packaged cold, shipped cold. I’m like, isn’t it ultimately up to my own refrigeration, sir?\n\nLatinos got great representation, the Dos Equis Most Interesting Man in the World. That lasted like 15 years, one of the greatest commercials of all time. So I wrote own version of it. It’s called The Most Asian Man in the World. You got an Asian actor on screen, an announcer in the back, and the music starts playing.\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\n“He graduated with a law degree, but now he’s a neurosurgeon. He’s 52 years old, but everyone still checks his ID. Whenever he takes a picture, he throws up the victory sign.”\n\nYou guys every realize, the closer the victory sign is to you face, the more Asian you look? Like, this is normal. This is some Mainland China WeChat shit, you know what I mean?\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nThat is some–\n\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\n“He is the most Asian man in the world.” And the Asian brother comes out. (CHINESE ACCENT) “I don’t always drink beer. But when I do, my face turn red. Stay thirsty, my friends.”\n\nThank you guys very much.\n\n[CHEERING]\n\nYou guys are amazing. Thank you.\n\n[MUSIC – METER MOBB FT TOO $HORT, “YOU CAME TO PARTY”]\n\n(SINGING) Let’s get wild tonight.\n\n♪ Turn the fuck up We’re going out tonight ♪\n♪ I’ve been waiting all my life ♪\n♪ Every time I go out, I think I found my wife ♪\n♪ I can’t help but turn down the lights ♪\n♪ I’m gonna take some down tonight ♪\n♪ This shit is so hot ♪\n♪ That’s what it’s sounding like, like you want ♪\n♪ to fuck around tonight, bitch ♪\n♪ I want you in every way ♪\n♪ The passion burns and it goes both ways ♪\n♪ When we’re not together, I’m in pain ♪\n♪ The mightiest ocean couldn’t put out this flame ♪\n♪ I think she’s coming with me ♪\n♪ You wanna say bye but she leaves ♪\n♪ Wanna say bye but she leaves ♪\n♪ Tears drop like autumn leaves, tear drops, tear drops ♪\n♪ You better make time to breathe, yeah ♪"

It's great seeing this great seeing a fellow comedian that I don't think I've been inside a comedy club or seen any comedian for two months now. It's weird.\n\n\nIt's like they're trying to get it out of our system. Like they're trying to look like if we're junkies, if we're comedy junkies, we've gone to a rehab. You have to live like a regular person.\n\n\nIt's must have. I mean, I've gotten past a phase of like because back in the day, if I didn't do stand up for a week, I'll get depressed because there's nothing else going on in my life.\n\n\nBut now I got other stuff going I can do writing, whatever, but I feel bad for like the road guys.\n\n\nOh yeah. And the open micas. That's just coming up. Oh yeah. And I'm sure you've gotten this. Are a lot of people inviting you to do virtual virtual stand up comedy shows on Zoome.\n\n\nYeah, they can each. It did. That is the worst idea on the fucking planet bro.\n\n\nEven great comics look terrible on those and they can record you. Exactly. Exactly.\n\n\nAnd record you looking terrible. Bombing just it's just not the right place. It's like let's play basketball underwater. Yeah.\n\n\nThat doesn't work, but that shows you how desperate people are.\n\n\nThey would put their whole material on the line to do virtual no real people audience just to get the rocks off.\n\n\nDave Chappelle's got a very unique solution. He's doing some shit in his backyard. He sent me well, not his backyard. His friend has a wedding pavilion, so he set up this thing at a wedding pavilion. All of it is covid safe. Look at that. That's Dave on stage in Ohio at a wedding pavilion.\n\n\nOh, wow, dude. That's where people will get married.\n\n\nAnd Dave's up there doing stand up. Yeah, well, he's so good. He doesn't need like a low ceiling, you know, pack seats.\n\n\nHe just needs a crowd. And, you know, he also, I think. He's just he's he just figured out how to improvise, he's like, there's going to be a way to get around this. I'm going crazy.\n\n\nYeah, there's got to be a way and doing it outside, separating everybody. Following all the covid requirements. The governor actually had approved this. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah.\n\n\nHe's in Ohio. So the governor of Ohio approved all this. Why did this happen like recently? Just doing he just started doing it.\n\n\nHe texted me a couple days ago saying it was going to take like four days to work things out. We're making history over here, Joe Rogan, and.\n\n\nYeah. And then, you know, next thing you know, he's off and running this.\n\n\nI mean, comedy clubs probably got to be the last thing to open up right now. Not the last thing I think, like Staples Center, shit like that arenas big places. That's going to be the last thing. Restaurants are slowly starting to. There it is. Boom. What is this Brooklyn vegan you?\n\n\nYeah, it's a very reputable it's just like, boy, is that fraught with peril.\n\n\nPeople that are really into being from Brooklyn and people that are really into telling you they're vegan together at last.\n\n\nSpeaking of improvisation, I'm always very jealous because I think my buddy Ben Schwartz and Thomas Middleditch, they did improvising show on Netflix.\n\n\nRight. And that is like the ultimate hack to people like us that take like my first special took me ten years and now these guys can crank out five in a day because it's improvised. I'm like, what are we doing here?\n\n\nWell, I remember the first time I saw you is at the Improv. I saw you kill in that little tiny room of death. That lab is death. Everybody eats shit in that lab. That is the worst ever since they remodeled this lab. Half the room is a bar. Yes.\n\n\nAnd then there's pillars in the front of the stage. And right next to you is where the door is. So people are coming in the door. There's all this chit chat, talking and buying tickets. It's right there. But you were killing. And I was like, damn, this dude's legit. Funny because you have to be funny to kill in that bizarre involves, you know, like shit in that room. I seen a lot of people eat shit in that room.\n\n\nIt's a tough room. And sometimes you want to start in that small room and then do another set in a big room. So you go home happy. I did the wrong way.\n\n\nThat's the worst feeling room that I came to. The little room was like ten people in there and eight shit. Yeah. And then you first said you're completely forgotten and then you're just like, well, I'm a piece of shit and I do stand up. Not only that, I strolled in cocky because I just killed them like I know how to kill a fucking professional here.\n\n\nI went up in there and bombed.\n\n\nYeah, it's a it's just a terrible setup. They know it, though.\n\n\nThey've remodeled that improv more than any other fucking club I've ever even heard of. Why the whole setup was fine. They don't listen.\n\n\nThey just they just say, I got an idea. And then everybody goes, OK, great. So, like, they put a new green room that you have to duck to get into. Have you seen that new green room? It's upstairs that no one's ever going to use ever. Yeah. And then you go down the stairs from that new green room and it takes you right to where the stages wait the the one with the piano and stuff.\n\n\nWell, that's the other green room. OK, no, I haven't seen the other fucking green rooms. Huh.\n\n\nIt's the dumbest setup of all time. The main room is a great room, no great room. It's like it's one of the all time classic rooms. They haven't fucked that up.\n\n\nI still think the improv in L.A., it's my favorite place. It's a great place. Yeah. And they show me love, like early on. You know, it's really like page. It's been great. Read a page and Rita are awesome.\n\n\nThey're the salt of the earth, both those people. It's a nice environment. It just was weird that you had to kind of wait in the hallway before you go on stage.\n\n\nAnd so you kind of got molested by weirdos would come out and ask questions and shit while you're trying to get your brother, what sometimes as a single guy, that's actually that might be the good move down.\n\n\nYou know, I mean, Laugh Factory idea set. You get the fuck out, right? You don't get to meet nobody. You know, improv.\n\n\nEd, you said you hang out at the bar and I know some girls come talk to you like, you know, you have to swim through some weirdos.\n\n\nYou do have time to weirdos. It's fine. And some dudes will just wedge themselves between you and a girl, too, right? If you're trying to chit chat with a lady, they go, Hey, Jimmy.\n\n\nHi, Jimmy. You were really funny. I got to talk to you about something. I'm I'm starting a virtual comedy club, and I'd love to have you be a part of it.\n\n\nThere's been a lot of pitches that I inadvertently said yes to because I was half drunk at the bar.\n\n\nIt's like, hey, man, let me tell you about the show in Silverlake. It's kind of near Echo Park, but really it's in Boyle Heights. But great open mic, man. You know, Jamie Kennedy, he's done it.\n\n\nYou got to do it. I was like, sure, why don't you send me an email and the next email I get I completely forgot about the interaction email I get.\n\n\nHe's like, So I got you on the show. Mayford team man. So you good. You're going to do fifteen. And I'm like, well, I'm out of town.\n\n\nWell, I can't say that because I'm like, did I did I agree to this because I don't remember.\n\n\nI was drunk. So I was like, sure, I'll come and I get suckered into these terrible things.\n\n\nYeah. You got to know how to say no. It's very important. Yeah, very important.\n\n\nWell, that's the thing about like the open mic community, there's always some dudes got some kind of a bringer show that they're putting something together. And it's always it's usually it's OK, it's good seasoning, you get on stage, do a little set, you know, at any stage of the game, it's always good to get on stage and weird crowds. Yeah, but the problem with a lot of those shows is you'll go on after, like two or three people that are deaf.\n\n\nThere is no comedy left in life and you'll be convinced that nothing is funny. It's impossible to be funny. Yeah. You know, I'm saying, like, you see someone really, really, really bad and it's like there's nothing to comedy on.\n\n\nComedy doesn't work because there's so many, I guess, approach to this. Right. Like, I think there's one that's like, you know, you don't want to follow someone that's too strong. Like if I go on stage after Chappelle kind of fucked, you know, he's both strong and super famous.\n\n\nYeah, it's a double hammer. Yeah. Like people believe in, you know, the store or whatever. But also there's the other side of it.\n\n\nIt's you want to ride a wave. Yeah.\n\n\nIf something that's doing well, you want to go in there and ride that wave. But then the opposite of it is if somebody is bad you can go on, you can kill it and then the crowd believes in you. But if somebody is too terrible, then it's dead.\n\n\nLike you have to spend your first five minutes just doing crowd was one of the signs of a terrible headliner is when they bring really bad openers just to look really good.\n\n\nYes. They don't want anybody stealing their thunder. So they're being like just complete scrubs.\n\n\nThat fucks me up, don't you know? Me too.\n\n\nI for me, my opener is more about energy. I want some of these energy that matches my level.\n\n\nBut it's funny or somebody that's kind of lower energy but really smart and good, because if you have somebody that goes super big, that that's kind of hard for me to do.\n\n\nAn hour of that same energy.\n\n\nNot the worst is the guy before he does music. Oh, no. You know that. So they they start doing songs. They have songs for shit. Oh my God. I never cared about an opening song.\n\n\nYou know, D.J., when you go on the road is like, hey, what song you come up to? I'm like, whatever, just play some top 40. Hip hop doesn't matter. Right. But then one of my openers has a very specific trick daddy song. I got shout out to my boy Derek Keehner. Hilarious guy, right.\n\n\nHe has a very energetic trick daddy song and that bit kills and it's kind of dirty and it's cool and I'm like, shit, I got to step my game up because if my opener is going up, what a killer song and I walk up the stage with nothing. Yeah. You know, it just doesn't seem right.\n\n\nIn the early 2000s and the late 90s, early 2000s, a lot of guys would have funny raps and they would close with a rap like a rap parody, a hilarious rap. So things rhyme, they're loud, there's a lot of gesturing and they're like, thank you, good night.\n\n\nAnd then you'd have to go up. So talk to my mom today.\n\n\nIt's I remember I used to do a bunch of like urban clubs and Jay Spot and remember Jay Spots and then a funny name, Urban Urban.\n\n\nWell I can see clubs, should I say Black Club or I guess it's a black club. Urban maybe more offensive. I don't know. But they call themselves Urban Club.\n\n\nIsn't that weird. That is weird. Why urban. It's a code word for black, right.\n\n\nIt's a good code because it also means a city like all clubs are in cities.\n\n\nWhen the fuck was you ever done a club in the woods? Right. Well, those aren't rural.\n\n\nIt's like the word urban at inner city for some reason. Right. Isn't that kind of the same thing?\n\n\nBut I mean, like there's urban clubs in L.A. that are just downtown. Oh, right. Is not that one. What does that one club. Garrett Morris is clawed back in the day. No, there's a club downtown that's a block club.\n\n\nIt's supposed to be real good. I don't remember, but I just thought the term urban is just very weird.\n\n\nI remember.\n\n\nSo when I hit the jackpot, I don't know if it's still there. The jackpot, it's opened by Jay Anthony Brown.\n\n\nI was pretty, very green, you know, and I was on top of Yoshinari it, but it's pop club, right?\n\n\nAnd remember, Jay, come up to me on my set was like 15 minutes.\n\n\nHe was like, you got any music? Cuz I was like, no, just play whatever he's like. Are you sure.\n\n\nI was like yeah, no I don't have any music. He was like, you don't want me to play anything in your set.\n\n\nI was like, no, why would you do that. And then I realized I watch all the other comics. Everybody had like five music skits and the crowd loved it and they were killing it. And then I went I was just trying to do my observational humor and just a shit, you know, because it's just everybody is doing that.\n\n\nYou're not like you're at a complete disadvantage. Yeah.\n\n\nThere's a famous story about Mitch Hedberg. Mitch Hedberg was on the road in Ohio and he was doing this club. And for whatever reason, the manager of the club decided to book this guy who was like super high energy. And he had music. And I think he did like acrobatics on stage and shit like crazy stuff. And, yeah, got everybody riled up.\n\n\nAnd then Mitch would go on there and everything was like and he was bombing and they wanted to switch Mitch with him and pay him less money.\n\n\nAnd it was like this big fucking deal. It's like, no, man, you fucked up. It's not like Mitch isn't great.\n\n\nYou run a comedy club, you know who Mitch Hedberg is. You know he's great.\n\n\nYeah. Why are you having a guy who does back flips to fucking bass beats before him? You can't do that.\n\n\nYou ever do the comedy Magic Club? Sure. One of my favorite clubs, you know, they have ten comedians on there, but sometimes you got to follow a magician or a juggler.\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nYou know, I stopped doing that there. I said, listen, we had a bunch of issues there. One issues they would not. Let me bring up Joey Diaz.\n\n\nOh, why? Because he's not klinz too dirty. But I'm dirty, too. But I'm like, whatever. For whatever reason, I can get away with it for him. So I love the guy to death.\n\n\nMike is the best, but he wouldn't let Joey go up because I love but he's just not my crowd. Is just this your crowd people, the humans, they come to see me. Trust me, it is a different crowd.\n\n\nAnd I do kind of like it because if you just run your set at the Improv or the factory or whatever.\n\n\nRight. And then you take on the road, sometimes it doesn't translate. But the the comedy magic crowd is like almost like a Midwest white crowd, which is sort of urban.\n\n\nYes. What is to be a code word for a white crowd suburb like suburban crowd.\n\n\nThey're like gated beach community crowd. Yeah. The one percenter crowd older to go like Jay Leno fans. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n\nCause Jay Leno used to work out his Tonight Show set every Sunday night there. That was his thing.\n\n\nHe used to go there and he had all his monologue shit and would work it out at the comedy Magic on Sunday night.\n\n\nYeah, there definitely. I mean, it really helped me because Richard and Mike gave me a lot of stage time coming up.\n\n\nAnd they're great folks. They're really nice. And the club is ran.\n\n\nSo they actually care about the comics. Like usually, you know, you do the problem. There's no knock to the improv, but you got to sign a W nine and give you five bucks in cash.\n\n\nThat's just the way it is. The Improv. Right. And then you go to County Magic Club.\n\n\nIt's, I think, fifty dollars a set, which is very nice for like a quick Yeah. For like a quick set.\n\n\nBut then if you do it on Valentine's Day they don't tell you, hey, we're going to pay you whatever. They just come down, do Valentine's Day because we like it, but they sell these Valentine's Day packages. And then at the end of the day, I think I open up. It was like a thousand dollars.\n\n\nThey just gave all of us a thousand dollar checks. It was like really, really nice for a comic that really needs the food.\n\n\nThere is really good real filet mignon in comedy club. Yeah. Like a real restaurant that you would go to.\n\n\nYou'd go there as a restaurant. Yeah.\n\n\nYeah. That was a great spot.\n\n\nBut it is I don't know why I it's too I tell my stories like my Asian stories or whatever, but like you can tell, like people come up to me like hey man, I was funny but like, you know, like when they talk to themselves they like.\n\n\nYeah. That, that Asian that oriental boy kind of funny. Like, you know, you know, there's some kind of that going on. Like I am so foreign to them. They found it refreshing that I can't believe that Oriental boy spoke English style kind of get that vibe over there.\n\n\nYou know, isn't it funny that Oriental became like taboo, like the term Oriental?\n\n\nIt's it's a weird one. And people that say Oriental did never mean harm. No. You know, just old.\n\n\nThey always the old like it's my buddy's fathers in high school.\n\n\nYeah. They're like. Right. So you and your Oriental parents.\n\n\nYou guys. Like, they're trying to be so pissy, it's like when people call black people African-Americans because they are too careful, you know, and that's kind of weird, you know, right? Yeah, I don't love it.\n\n\nIt's just I mean, Woody.\n\n\nWell, Jamaicans are like someone who comes from Jamaica and lives. And I guess technically you'd be an African-American because Africans went to Jamaica first. Right. And then to America.\n\n\nIt's odd.\n\n\nYeah, it's all weird, man. It's all but just like for Asian folks, like also people get upset if you can't make the distinction.\n\n\nYes. Asians have a lot of beef amongst each other.\n\n\nJoe Boy has a great bit about that.\n\n\nThere's a hierarchy for sure. What's the top of the food chain?\n\n\nWhat put him in a spot here? But I think, look, this is I think generally it's you have your main like Korean, Chinese, Japanese. And then they sometimes look down at the Southeast Asians.\n\n\nSo whatever Filipino, Thai, whatever Vietnamese probably.\n\n\nBut then if you call a Chinese person Japanese to get pissed. But if you call Japanese, I don't know the exact thing, but it could get ugly.\n\n\nIt could. And I mean, it's not just country to country. It could be like my Parents Day from Shanghai, you know, which is a very metropolitan like Manhattan of China.\n\n\nSo they have an elitist syndrome to them. And they look down at people from the South China or whatever. And then I grew up in Hong Kong, which was a British colony. Right. And it's a very different government.\n\n\nWe're a little more, I guess, progressive or whatever. Just a different city state.\n\n\nSo Hong Kong people has elitist syndrome towards mainland Chinese people, like my my dad came from Shanghai to Hong Kong, so he spoke Cantonese, which is to local Hong Kong dialect with Mandarin like a mainland guy accent.\n\n\nAnd they will always make fun of them as like the mainland guy.\n\n\nOh yeah. How does how does it like when you're seeing what's going on with Hong Kong right now where they're losing their autonomy to China, is that freak you out crazy?\n\n\nWell, yeah, it's very disheartening, but I think my dad saw that coming.\n\n\nYeah. You know, we moved here when I was thirteen the year 2000.\n\n\nThat was three years after the British gave Hong Kong back to China after one hundred year treaty.\n\n\nYeah, I guess they're like nice colonizers.\n\n\nThey're like, we're going to colonize you. But just just a hundred years and here you can have it back.\n\n\nIt seems like it's going downhill. The riots in the streets or excuse me, the protest, because they're extremely polite protests. It's the way they part the street for an ambulance is amazing. It's tough.\n\n\nAnd I think that's one of the main reasons, aside from education and all that, just more opportunities in America.\n\n\nThat was probably one of the main reasons why my family wanted to move out of Hong Kong, you know, to America.\n\n\nThey saw it coming because my dad grew up fifties, sixties, communist revolution. Motherfuckers would kick down your door and take everything. Both of my grandparents went to jail from both sides because they were intellectuals.\n\n\nI believe my my father's father, my grandfather was like a chemistry teacher and he was considerate intellectually.\n\n\nHe went to jail.\n\n\nSo they put him in jail just because he was an intellectual? I believe so.\n\n\nI don't know the exact story. But then I know uncles so were like talking shit that also went to jail. A lot of people went to jail.\n\n\nSo when they went to jail because they were complaining. I think it's a mixture of things.\n\n\nYeah. You just they just fucking throw you in jail and they kick down your door and take your shit. Look, OK, now, now I said that I can never do a movie in China anymore.\n\n\nI'm sure I'm banned because you just said, yeah, but who knows.\n\n\nBut it's I, I get look, I don't ever try to get political my stand up or whatever, but I get mad when I see Hipster's in their house having Chairman Mao posters. I like wearing Chairman Mao T-shirts and shit.\n\n\nChairman Mao killed a lot of people. Man, that's like on the other side of the spectrum, you have a like a fucking Hitler poster in your house. But somehow that's cool. Right? Right, right.\n\n\nYou know, like it wasn't because all I know I don't know history that well, but I know the stories that my parents told me during the communist revolution, how they got fucked over.\n\n\nThere's something about Mao that's like it's intriguing for people that just look at it on the surface. Right.\n\n\nLike, same thing with Che Guevara. Like, he looks cool, right? Cool. Looking like a revolutionary. Oh, yeah. Murderer. Yeah. Murderer. Genocidal murderer. Tiananmen Square. Yeah. Right.\n\n\nNo, that was that was after all I think that was still.\n\n\nYeah. Communist dictatorship. And it's a it's in a weird place now. Right. Because it's capitalist but it's capitalist really run by this communist government like the communist government and the businesses are completely intertwined. It's. It's interesting because they can make policies to have less red tape because they can make policies faster, because the government, whatever they say, just goes, yeah, but then I guess you hope that it's a decent person in control.\n\n\nThat's the fear that people have here in the United States of competing with China, is that China has these advantages because their businesses are so their corporations are so intertwined with the government that we might do the same thing here. Mm hmm. I mean, it's just it's a weird sort of slippery slope as sort of as laws. And all your different rights get eroded.\n\n\nYou get closer and closer to the government being in control of things like these new laws that they've passed recently where the government can just look into your Internet searching with no warrant whatsoever. This was something that I don't know if you know about this part of the Patriot Act, that this was one of the things that was people were furious that Senator Sanders because Bernie Sanders didn't he wasn't there. He didn't show up for the vote. And if he had shown up and voted the other way, it wouldn't have passed.\n\n\nWhy didn't he show up? He won't comment. Oh, he won't. He's been reached out for to comment on it. He won't comment on it. But it's very disheartening. And a lot of people who are progressives are furious at him and they feel very, very betrayed by this because now no one even knows. Like you didn't know, right? Most people don't know. Well, the government can now look at all your dirty little searches.\n\n\nI don't care about that. Like, but but I should. It's a slippery slope, right? Is that the fear? Well, here's a fear.\n\n\nThe government is just people. You know, I don't want any I don't I don't think like I should be able to just go looking at Jamie's search, like just for whatever reason Jamie's at home.\n\n\nWhat if I have some code I can go. Just look what it was Jamie looking at.\n\n\nWhat is it? What are you searching for? That's that's creepy, right? It's creepy. Like, privacy is privacy. It's important. You should you should be able to reveal what you want to reveal. And if the government, which is just a bunch of people, can peer into your life but you can't peer into their life. Yeah, sets up abuse. It's the same. It's like it's power. It's the same thing you see with cops.\n\n\nRight. All this shit you see with cops, for sure, racism is involved. But you know what else is involved? Power. When you see that that old man get thrown to the ground, the one that Trump said is faking it, that bashed his head, bleeding out of his fucking head.\n\n\nAnd Trump's like very good actor. But, yeah, I mean, that's what Trump said. He said it seemed to have fallen too easily, but, yeah, he's fucking dead. He's an old man. Oh, God.\n\n\nThe fact that he said that that is this might be Tifa. Like what?\n\n\nAll of these conspiracy theories out there as an actor, I must say, if any of these people are conspiracy guys, they are they are fucking Daniel Day Lewis, like they are great actors, like, you know, like certain times.\n\n\nI even said like dumb YouTube videos of there's a funny YouTube video of somebody's girlfriend deleting his two KNBR account and he just destroyed. You could tell it took everything for him, like not to like hit her or like whatever. Right. He just he was just destroyed.\n\n\nHe was crying. And it's so my buddy's like, oh, I don't know, man, that's fake, dude.\n\n\nI was like, yo, that guy that guy is a fucking Emmy Award Oscar winning actor. That shit is fake. That is not easy to do.\n\n\nNo, people think everything is fake. Yeah. I think so many things are fake. So many people have sent me things.\n\n\nSo you think this is fake and like, oh Jesus Christ. Yeah, yeah.\n\n\nSome things are fake. That old man falling the way he did and bouncing his head off the fucking concrete in the middle of a huge protest.\n\n\nYeah, that was real, dude. Yeah, that's real. That's what happens when you push an old man.\n\n\nThat's just the fact that this is the president of the United States say that. Okay, bro, you would fall that way, too.\n\n\nHe's a minor trained actor and he has a blood PAC in the back of his head.\n\n\nLike, how can that pro wrestler like, oh, yeah, he fell onto a mat that was cut themselves with razors for years. So.\n\n\nSo that wound bleeds is I don't think you can hear the guy's head bounce off the ground. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's a thunk.\n\n\nThere's a hollow coconut like thunk when someone's head bounces off concrete. Yeah, it's fucking terrible.\n\n\nBut the fact that the president of United States didn't just think that, but he thought it would be a good idea to tweet that like he's fallen apart, all this protest, he's fallen apart.\n\n\nAnd also the fact that they denied that they use tear gas to clear out that square so that he can go to the church like, hey, man, there's video, there's video of tear gas, you know, oh, you want to call?\n\n\nIt's pepper gas. OK, you know what? That pepper gas they're using, you're not allowed to use that war. Yeah, you know that. Oh, really? Yeah. You're not allowed to use that shit in war. You can't use tear gas and it violates the Geneva Convention.\n\n\nIt's like a bio bio Google that makes sure I'm right about that. But I'm pretty sure I'm right. I'm pretty sure the argument that they're making is you can't use tear gas and war, but you should be able to use it in protests. And these cops are shooting rubber bullets.\n\n\nAnd, you know, people are losing their. Fucking eyes, here it is. The military is banned from using tear gas on the battlefield, but police can use it on crowds at home. Here's why. And this is on CNN. Just think about that. The military is fucking banned from using this, but you're using it on civilians that just want to protest the tortured death of a guy who was being detained by a cop who had a 14 year history of being a piece of shit and dozens of I mean, he had more than a dozen complaints of abusive behavior.\n\n\nAnd they're going to use tear gas in these people and just shoot rubber bullets randomly at folks.\n\n\nI don't know what it takes. What is the lowest common denominator?\n\n\nLike he has to murder someone, like in front of you and people still be like, yeah, yeah.\n\n\nOr whatever, because he's he's he's on the way out. I think it's it's it's slowly but surely stuff like this. He can't help himself and under pressure when when people are angry at him because of all this. And I think one of it's kind of crazy, but one of the big things that started it off where he really lost his composure was all that shit that he said about Lysol, like maybe get disinfectant and put it in the body, a cleansing when he started doing that.\n\n\nAnd then the next day they were asking him about it. I was being sarcastic to see how you reporters would call on it.\n\n\nLike, No, you weren't. You were ramblin. You were like, I've done that before. I'm rambling. But I would say, the fuck am I talking about? I don't know how you use Lysol in a person. Why am I saying this?\n\n\nHe's pitching. He's pitching as if, like, you're in the writers room and he's like, yeah, he tried this idea, you know, what about you, this character with that character?\n\n\nBut you don't do that as the president in public about health issues.\n\n\nSee, this CDC, some Americans are gargling with bleach or putting it on food to fight covid-19.\n\n\nIs that real? Really?\n\n\nI did like a survey of a couple of thousand people and somewhere in the range of like four percent of people admitted to me gargling or brandy or washing stuff with bleach.\n\n\nWell, this is this is Darwinism. Yeah. This is if you're over 18, go do it another way. But don't say that, Joe.\n\n\nDon't know if you're younger and you're young and you don't know any better. You just you're not uneducated. But at a certain age, like you should know not to fucking gargle with bleach.\n\n\nRight. Tide pod challenge all over again.\n\n\nIt's tide pod challenge. But it'll tell you it's interesting, even like I stay off Twitter, all of that stuff, I don't talk.\n\n\nThank you. I just it's it's tough out there. I want to delete my Twitter account.\n\n\nIt's so toxic these days. I'm in a tweet thread or a text thread, rather, with a couple of comedians, and they'll send me the most egregious, ridiculous things that are going on on Twitter with people arguing about all kinds of crazy shit. And I'm like, man, this is toxic.\n\n\nLike you're reading into these this a lot of these people have like severe depression and mental health issues and they're lashing out at people and and they have these like like witch hunts.\n\n\nAnd they go after folks for jokes from 14 years ago and attack them and put up screenshots and and they think there's somehow or another, like, doing something positive. And did you do it? Tourist's Twitter scrub of like old tweets deleting.\n\n\nI did that. I mean, I see every day the actors getting fired and shit. None of my stuff was, like, terrible, but it was just like bad jokes.\n\n\nWell, the problem is with us in particular, we say the most ridiculous shit to each other all the time.\n\n\nYes. And then Twitter was like a lot of it was like trying jokes out. And a lot of it was like you had a hot take on something that was ridiculous and you knew was offensive.\n\n\nBut you're only saying it for fun. Yeah. And then people take those things out of context and they pretend that it's like your real feelings and thoughts like these are jokes. People say ridiculous shit that they don't really mean because they want to get you to laugh.\n\n\nThat's all it is. And if you take those out of context, it can look pretty bad. If I'm like, you're like a pretty pure comedian, you know, I have to kind of, you know, I act and stuff.\n\n\nAnd that that was a totally different world. That world sucks because you can't really say anything.\n\n\nSo even when I do stand, like, what the fuck, what am I supposed to like? I can only I've learned my lesson is only telling my stories.\n\n\nYou can't argue with that, right.\n\n\nLike I'm just telling you stories about my father or like me growing up in Hong Kong, exactly what are going to say. I'm a fucking asshole because I'm telling my because I grew up a certain way like so that's the only thing that I found the land that I as people can't for now.\n\n\nI can't for now.\n\n\nBut as things get more and more ridiculous, eventually one day they'll be able to get mad at you for that. Like they just once everything's been cleared out and people have been purified, they just move the goalposts.\n\n\nYeah. They find something thing that's offensive to say or do. There's things that people are getting fired for today that three months ago you could say easily and people would agree with you. It's just weird to say it to your friends.\n\n\nDon't tweet about it. I guess is the lesson. Well, the thing is, a lot of people tweeted, you know, fuck in 2008, they tweeted it and then someone will go back and find it 12 years later and you get in trouble and you get fired.\n\n\nPeople are getting fired for old tweets, like, I'm really glad I don't have a job job like where someone hires me or fires me, because just as I've said a million things in the podcast, drunk or high or talking shit with comedians, where you just try to make to laugh and say stupid shit.\n\n\nYeah. And, you know, and then if you take that out, if you don't see the whole podcast and get the vibe of how we talk. Right. And the conversation, you just make a snippet out of it. You can make someone look like a real piece of shit. But it's it's disingenuous. It's disingenuous. It's deceptive. They know what they're doing. They know that they're trying to paint a very distorted perception of who these people are when they're taking their tweets and taking them out of context and putting them up there and and trying to get them cancelled.\n\n\nThey have rocks. It's just like a looter in a lot of ways. Like they have rocks and there's a window and they want to throw a rock at the window.\n\n\nYou know how the military hires hackers to hack into their own system? Yeah. To see how vulnerable they are. I think there should be a new job out there for comedians, celebrities to hire these Twitter people to see if they can dig up any dirt.\n\n\nAnd I'll give them five grand if you can find anything.\n\n\nRight, just to prevent some sort of tweet storm. Yeah. Against you. That's a good idea, actually. It's actually a good idea for actors like they should do that before.\n\n\nWell, I know they do do that now when they hire someone for any sort of prominent whether it's you're going to be on the Today show or you going to host some show or you're going to be a sitcom actor, they'll check your fucking tweets.\n\n\nNow, they want to make sure they're not, especially if you're a comic, right?\n\n\nThey look at us like we're criminals. They look at us like, what do you do? It would have been up.\n\n\nYou would even do when no one's looking at what you been writing on your own, you fucking weirdo. Yeah. Trying to make people laugh, you ridiculous shit. That's why the virtual shows are the worst.\n\n\nAnd imagine trying a joke on Zoome. They recorded canceled. You get canceled after zoom virtuoso.\n\n\nOh it could happen.\n\n\nIt could happen. Yeah. Yeah. Well you know what's interesting though I think I was talking to my buddies about this if if I think I'm a nice guy, if somehow there was an old tweet somebody found and it's some bullshit and they're trying to cancel me, do you think you or like friends of mine would speak on me?\n\n\nHey, man, he's actually a good guy.\n\n\nI would 100 percent speak up for you 100 percent. Right. So so I think the people that actually got tweets dug up about them, there's two way.\n\n\nSometimes you get people speaking. I was like, no, no, no. He's actually a good guy. But most of the time it's like, yeah, he was an asshole.\n\n\nYeah. He actually didn't hire no black people because blah, blah. So I think it's a combination of both. That tweet just exposes a little bit of that person and then everybody jumps on and it's like, yeah, no, you know what? He's actually a dick.\n\n\nIt could be or it could be. The person who's getting attacked is does not have a high profile friend. And they're you know, they're kind of like just starting out and maybe they've got a job somewhere and none of their friends have any clout. So they can't really speak up for them. And if they did, they'd get canceled. So they're scared.\n\n\nThey're scared of the mob because it really is a mob man.\n\n\nWhen an Internet mob comes after you, you know, it's it's just not a good way to communicate.\n\n\nYou know, there's an interesting guy who had a tweet about this one to pull this up.\n\n\nThere's a gentleman named Whereases Tweet here.\n\n\nThere it is. OK, Alex Levin, Ovid's, I'm sure I'm saying this right, Levin Novick's Alan I'm sorry, Alan Levine. Its trying to read his last name. Can't I glossed over his first name but he had a really interesting point that what we're eating when people get sick, you're eating highly processed food. Right.\n\n\nYou're not eating healthy natural food when you're consuming tweets and you're getting a lot of your information from Twitter and social media, you're getting highly processed information.\n\n\nAnd he was saying it's just as bad for you as processed food and then it's unnatural and it doesn't come in a natural form.\n\n\nAnd I was like, that's a very excellent point. The way he put his his Twitter handle is Alan ALJ and Levie and overmighty Z. I'm going have him on the podcast. He's an author and a professor. He's just to the point was excellent. Like I've said, I had a similar point that I said to many people, like consuming gossip and bullshit, and you're watching stupid television shows, reality shows in your mental diet is very poor.\n\n\nBut I think the way he formed that is actually even better, that it's really highly processed because the form you're getting tweets right, you're getting 280 characters that form of like data and information. There's no social cues, there's no context, there's no nuance. And you're getting this very weird message and you can decide good or bad, good message. Bad message, bad person. Good person. Yeah, it's hard. It's it's.\n\n\nAnd then anger know there's no there's no real way to me it's a bad way to exchange information with other human beings. What's the anonymity of it like.\n\n\nPeople wouldn't say that shit to your face. They say they're going to get beat up or just there's a common courtesy when you're talking face to face. I wouldn't say certain things to you when you're in person.\n\n\nYeah, but when you're anonymous and then you're angry, that's it's not it's also convene.\n\n\nYou can demonize someone and attack them. And you don't care if you get them fired because they had a weird Halloween picture. They dressed up like an Indian in nineteen eighty eight, you know, you know, I mean like there's a lot of that shit going around. We should all delete our Twitters.\n\n\nI don't know why people have Twitter anymore. Well it's good for promoting shows when we used to have shows.\n\n\nRight. Yeah. Yeah. I never my Twitter never caught on because my shit is so vanilla, you know, because I don't ever say controversial shit. And that's how you get followers.\n\n\nWell, you're smart. Yeah. Well, controversial shit helps. I used to read tweet a lot of cool shit that people sent me that I had to stop listening, reading things that people are sending me.\n\n\nThe one thing I ever really recently tweeted about was I don't even want to mention this, but the whole changeless thing with SNL, I was sitting in my trailer. I was just angry as an Asian person reading this. And then I just said, no, this guy should not be here, blah, blah, you know, like almost I became the mobs, but I was just angry and I never thought about it.\n\n\nAnd I got so much flak, you know, even saying something that I thought was right for my experience, what I thought.\n\n\nAnd then ever since then, I'll just like, forget it. You know, I'm going to I'm only going to re tweet other people's shit. I have no opinions.\n\n\nYou know, the Shane Gillis thing was very weird because, like, they're talking shit, right?\n\n\nThey're trying to be offensive, to be funny.\n\n\nAnd no one was listening. Right. When they were doing it.\n\n\nAnd there's like, you know, a thousand people downloading their podcast. They just thought they were just being offensive and saying ridiculous shit because you can and because you make each other laugh. I don't think I don't think he's racist. I don't think he's a bad guy. I think he's just talking shit. It's the casualness.\n\n\nYes. I think that was what got to me. It's like, damn, yeah, they're just white people in their rooms talking about us like that. Like, that sucks, you know?\n\n\nAnd I think they probably wouldn't talk like that if no one was around. It's weird. It's like you're talking like that because, you know, it's taboo to talk like that. It's part of the fun of doing it.\n\n\nIt's it's not it's I mean, you know, all your racial racist apologist. I'm not I'm not apologizing for it, but I am saying that's what a lot of those kind of guys do. This is like a shock aspect to certain comedy where they try to make each other laugh by saying, shit, you're not supposed to say. And he he had some fucking great sketches. There was a great sketch that he put up that Norm MacDonald retweeted because no one was upset that he got fired for it all.\n\n\nAnd it was about people taking things the wrong way and misunderstanding and running with the worst possible scenario. And it just like compounded. It was a really great sketch, but I shouldn't have brought that up.\n\n\nAnd now people are going to tweet at me, no, you're fucking an asshole comic. Try to get another comic fired. But yeah, I get it.\n\n\nYou know, look, I get it, man. Especially being a minority in America. I get it being an Asian.\n\n\nLike I say this in my standup. It's like people coming up. Thanks for representation. I love it. I love it. Yeah. I love represent Asians, but it wasn't a choice.\n\n\nWhen you wake up Asian, when you wake up Asian, you can only representations and there's some kind of responsibility.\n\n\nSo I was talking to Steve Aoki about Bruce Lee. Oh no. I'm a giant Bruce Lee fan. We were talking Bruce Lee stories and he was saying that like when he was a kid, it's like Bruce Lee was like finally like Asians had this represented just bad ass representative, you know, it just didn't exist before in popular culture.\n\n\nLike, that's how unique Bruce Lee is.\n\n\nIf you really stop and think about it, like there was literally no one any even remotely like him in pop culture before him and then burst onto the scene. And then it was like a ton of fake ones.\n\n\nThere was Bruce Lee, you remember do you know Bruce Lee? What? Bruce Lee died.\n\n\nThey had this guy named Bruce Lee dressed like Bruce Lee and do very slim. We're moving to Bruce Lee and Bruce Lee, fans like myself, we like I'll take it, it's like, you know, was he was Asian, though, right?\n\n\nOK, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, Bruce Lee was huge.\n\n\nI mean, you can tell his impact 40 years later, he is still one of the most Asian famous Asian sex symbols.\n\n\nYeah. And representation. It's extremely important in that sense because I have had girls tell me this is just anecdotal.\n\n\nHe can't hate me for this story. But I mean, it's just a fun story.\n\n\nBut this girl told me she was like a white girl. She was like, you know, when I watched The Crow, which is Brandon Lee's movie, his son, he was like, when I watched a crow, I felt like that was my sexual awakening when I was 15 years old.\n\n\nAnd guess what? I sex with her that night. I mean, like, that shit matters, bro.\n\n\nLike, I swear, I went crazy. Rich Asians came out and everybody was watching it.\n\n\nPeople want to want to start fucking Asian dudes. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n\nSadly, I don't know statistically. You know, I think that there's some research on plenty of fish or some Asian dudes. And black women are the least likely to get a match on dating apps.\n\n\nI don't know. I spy a much bigger systematic conversation because we were, you know, emasculated, blah, blah.\n\n\nBut I think what, Representative, if you had like ten more Bruce, you know, or ten more crazy rich Asians, that really helps.\n\n\nJust the more representation you or me, I'm just going to blow the fuck up.\n\n\nI'm doing fine. I'm fine. I need some other brothers to or some some white girl to be watching my stand up and be like, you know, I'm going to go fucking Asian guy.\n\n\nThat's important, man.\n\n\nThat that's my my dream in this business is to help other Asian brothers get laid. I think you can do it.\n\n\nI hope so. I have faith in you. I might just do that. So you should do that to whatever. You should be the only guy that has a dual career like successful comedian, successful porn star that there's something about.\n\n\nRight? If you decide to become a porn star, it taints you for everything else.\n\n\nComedy, though. Yeah, I think so.\n\n\nReally? Yeah. I don't think my acting career started slinging Dick now be hilarious. It would be kind of funny, but do you think that it would taint his comedy career at all.\n\n\nHow this dick game now houses did came up. It is pretty fucking strong if a strong day came. I think. I hope you think so. I think maybe maybe somebody has got to be brave enough to do it.\n\n\nDo you remember when Snoop Dogg was like hosting pornos? He was, yeah.\n\n\nHe was hosting them, yeah. What does that even mean? Like he would be like in the room like oh shit. People are fucking like he is.\n\n\nHe was doing things, he was doing things with porn.\n\n\nI'm, I'm sure I'm right about this but who wants that doggy style. Yeah.\n\n\nYeah. Dogs. Oh so he had like porn that he was like put look Snoop Dog is beyond reproach.\n\n\nHe's so cool he's going away with everything. Yeah. Get away with everything in anything no matter what it is. But that's a bad idea to start with.\n\n\nI don't even like the dude talking shit when he's like fucking you know, I don't I don't want any noise from the man I like.\n\n\nI like like this one guy. I think his name is like a black porn star like Wesley Pipes.\n\n\nI don't know. I mean, maybe I know too much about porn, but he may talk some shit and it's cause I'm like, yo, shut up, doglike. Let me let me just concentrate. Yeah, dude. To be very careful here, but just showing you guys.\n\n\nOh yeah. We can't really see this right now but the sun up it's available to find.\n\n\nAnd so, so the girls were like doing all their stuff and he's like he's not doing porn but he's like producing it. Right.\n\n\nHe's not in the same room. Right. He's like I don't think so.\n\n\nThat's probably a good advisers like Snoop. Let's keep you in the other room. Yeah.\n\n\nThis is back one like we had the authorized button on the cable boxes, which doesn't really exist anymore. Remember that? No. It's like how you bought paper views. You had to press a button. You go to the channel and then like if you wanted it, you hit authorize and like for three ninety nine you get to watch whatever was on I don't really room.\n\n\nAnd that's how this like.\n\n\nYeah, that's how I like when cable boxes first came out.\n\n\nYou press it on the box itself on the on the remote control authorized button.\n\n\nSo there's a D.J. there. Easy for kids to buy paper. It's a whole party and then it becomes porn.\n\n\nLooks like it. I mean, I'm no detective. The girl's got her pants off now. So there you go. Jeez Louise. I think it's like the after parties. After the show.\n\n\nYeah. But that oh, there's no we're all dancing and everybody's having a good time, OK? Seen enough, Dutrow? I don't know if I like that like this. I don't know if I like that. You know, it's too casual to fuckin us. Too casual. Right. Right. It's out in a party.\n\n\nEveryone's out in the open in the middle of like it's seemed like there by a pool. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of a pool party fuck party type of vibe. Yeah.\n\n\nHmm. Yeah. Maybe I'll consider point Poincaré but it's weird right.\n\n\nBecause everybody wants to fuck but nobody wants you to fuck on film.\n\n\nI can take you like if you found out that Scarlett Johansson was having sex you'd like.\n\n\nOf course she's having sex. She's a beautiful girl. She probably likes men and she has sex. But if you if you said Kalid, Scarlett Johansson wants to have sex on film and you can watch everybody like what's wrong with her.\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\nYeah. But I mean, look like Sasha, great porn star who became kind of an actress, one of those Soderbergh movies.\n\n\nHow many did she do the girlfriend experience?\n\n\nI know she did a couple of things. She's an odd case, right? She's very smart. Yeah. She's, I think, a decent actress, but she'll never make it to that next level because she was a porn star.\n\n\nNow, has anybody done the reverse where they're actor and then became a porn star and then went back to acting? Because you establish yourself as an actor?\n\n\nI don't think they've ever gone back.\n\n\nIt's one of those Hail Mary last ditch effort things. I think Dustin Diamond after's from scratch. Yeah, I think he say by that pawn. Right. I'm sure. But that was after he hasn't acted. Didn't he stab somebody that he stabbed somebody. Yeah, he did a lot of shit. He did stand up, stab somebody, fuck people did a lot of rich life.\n\n\nI like how stand up is grouped into that rock bottom.\n\n\nIt is the we're grouped into porn stars and strippers.\n\n\nI think he did stand up after that porn. I think it's porn. Stand up stabbing people.\n\n\nI think it was stand up stabbing people porn. But I might be wrong.\n\n\nWe're all just one step away from someone.\n\n\nWhat do you know about do you know Vincent Gallo, the actor? Yeah. Yeah, great actor. But ruined his career by getting a real blowjob in a movie that he produced.\n\n\nWell, that's that, I think. Yes, I think I brought on Bunny. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. I got. That was recent. Well, no, no, it's like more than a decade ago. OK, no, no, no, no. Yeah.\n\n\nI want to say to early two thousands. I want to say 2004, maybe something like that, that Salani I don't know what story is, but that sounds kind of shady.\n\n\nAnd me too. If you're the producer and the star and you're getting a blowjob.\n\n\nYeah, for sure. Yeah. You could definitely see that 2003. Yeah. Brown buddy. So it's with I don't know how to say her name. Chloes.\n\n\nHow do you say her name. Silvania. Is that is that is it. I don't know.\n\n\nShe's, she's bounced back but I don't necessarily believe that he has and he's a really interesting like. But what is it. Buffalo 64.\n\n\nIs that what the name of that movie is. It's really weird. Interesting movie. He did some interesting shit. What does that his Buffalo movie, Buffalo Sixty six. Really interesting movie. He's a great actor, but he decided, I think he was like, you know, he's out there. Right. He's a real artist and probably also a pervert.\n\n\nAnd he's like, listen, I don't you just suck my dick for real.\n\n\nAnd Chloes like, let's do it. I'm an artist, too.\n\n\nAnd so she really sucked his dick. And it was it was pretty hot, but people got very mad.\n\n\nThey got very mad because they went to see the critics were fucking furious because they went to see it. And instead of it being like simulated, it was actual sex. Mm hmm.\n\n\nIt's weird, right? Like, you could simulate violence. Right. Like John Wick movies. I fucking love John. Crazy. Great. But it's hard to plan. Yeah. Brains are splattered. Dudes are getting stabbed. The eyeball. Everybody is fine with it because you know, it's not real. Yeah.\n\n\nCould you have simulated sex if you know for sure it's a rubber dick and a plastic pussy. Fine. Like show penetration. Fine. It's fake penetration, folks. No need to worry. Nobody felt really good while they were doing this.\n\n\nThis is just rubber on plastic wrap. Yeah, we had a there was a robot the robot was pushing and it's a fake dick and it's all CGI.\n\n\nWould everybody be cool with that?\n\n\nWell, you know what's interesting now that he told me I like real sex scenes inside of movie, those movies, Nymphomaniac. What's ADOS name? Van. Something like he's a European guy.\n\n\nI don't know about those. And that was like those was like real sex scenes and I think real double penetration in those movies.\n\n\nBut it was it was like, I guess like a good considered a really good envelope push and type of movie.\n\n\nSo maybe if you European you can get away with it.\n\n\nYeah, they have different standards. I was in Germany and I was flipping through the channels one time and just raw porn was on regular TV.\n\n\nI was like, oh OK. Just raw porn, just regular porn.\n\n\nPeople are fucking it's kind of cool I guess for them. Like you want to watch people. Fuck, here you go. I don't get I don't get the appeal of it because there's pornhub now.\n\n\nI think what people are trying to do is what I'm saying about violence, like why are we so OK with overt like spectacular violence, but we're not OK with like if you knew like CGI is so good now, it's so good.\n\n\nYou know, you can have monsters that aren't really there. They're all created by a computer. Yeah. Why can't you could you have CGI sex? Would people be OK with that or are we so freaked out by penetration that we don't even want to watch fake penetration and nobody wants to get a boner next to the family in the that it is?\n\n\nMaybe maybe it's the shame thing like they feel for so distorted.\n\n\nWe don't care if someone gets their brains beaten in. Like one of the scenes on television that made me abandoned. Walking Dead was when that was his name, Negan doesn't he beat Glen to death with a baseball bat, beat him over the head, his fucking eyes hanging out. And I'm like, this is murder porn.\n\n\nLike, what is this? Why are you making me watch this? This is not fun. I don't want to watch someone get literally splatter like he's beating them over the head. His brain is splattered like like a watermelon. It dropped off the top of a building. It was terrible. Yeah, that's OK.\n\n\nBut you couldn't if you had a scene in that movie where a man went down on a woman who was eating her pussy and you could see him eating her pussy.\n\n\nPeople like this is outrageous. This is disgusting. Get it off the TV. She's enjoying it every minute of it. She got her feet up in the air moaning.\n\n\nHe's there, but she's happy.\n\n\nPeople would be like, this is a terrible movie. You're a piece of shit. I can't believe you did this.\n\n\nI think it's a shame you got it. Everybody watches porn and jerks off, but not everybody.\n\n\nYou got to really like 40 or 50 people that don't even touch it. That's tough. Just out there drinking water and running. Yeah, yeah.\n\n\nI don't I don't trust those people. I used to have my my whole life, my old roommate, we used to watch Game of Thrones together and great show, you know. But there are certain seasons that slower than the other seasons, and I didn't like it because I was like, oh, I wish the storyline would go faster or the character would get developed faster. And my buddy thought he here just like, man, I would stop watching the show.\n\n\nThere hasn't been any fucking in the last four episodes and I didn't understand why he doesn't just go watch PornHub or something like why does he watch Game of Thrones only for fucking.\n\n\nYeah, some people are unique. Yeah, it's a different take on things.\n\n\nBut this brown Bonnyman that tanked Vincent Gallo's career, I mean, you don't hear about him anymore.\n\n\nHe was a big star, like he was in a lot of like really interesting movies that were well respected. And it was a big deal. And this one movie 17 years ago, fucking what's he doing now?\n\n\nHe might as well just double down and do porn.\n\n\nNo, I think you went back to doing movies, and I think he just does, you know, kind of obscure arthouse movies. Probably that is the question that people don't really know about that much.\n\n\nYou just don't hear his name. And he's it's a shame because he's a really fucking great actor.\n\n\nHe just had this idea and his logic, it's it's you know, it's trackable.\n\n\nYou get it like I'm going to she's going to actually blow me for real instead of like a scene where a woman like if there was a scene they're making out and the girl goes down, you just see her head and he's like, oh, and we're fine with that. We're fine with that. Yeah.\n\n\nWe don't want to actually see a dick in a woman's mouth, though, even though we know that's what it's supposed to be. Well, but also maybe it's because he produced it or wrote it like that's like me writing a sex scene for myself.\n\n\nThat's gross. Yeah. Like that's me too for sure.\n\n\nOh unless your girlfriend was the actress and you guys talked about it and she's cool with it and she wanted to do it. Yeah. I don't know what kind of relationship you had with Chloe a but.\n\n\nWell but that's the real like did like especially today in the meta era. You can fucking never get away with that unless it was the girls idea, you know, and like so you'd have to get her on video saying it's my idea to suck your dick, I want to do it.\n\n\nWell, you don't have to like get lawyers involved, have to sign NDAs.\n\n\nI have to sign consent forms.\n\n\nI sadly have I don't think I've ever had a sex scene in in anything. I don't think that's an issue. Yeah.\n\n\nI just feel like, oh, what am I am I not like not a sex symbol? Is that what's bothering you? A little bit. I mean, time to write a movie, bro.\n\n\nYeah. Yeah, I've been, I've been I still I still can't I can't write my own sex scene.\n\n\nSomebody's got to write it for me.\n\n\nWasn't that a part of that ridiculously bad movie called The Room Sex Scene. Oh, so gross.\n\n\nSo gross. But the James Franco movie version was.\n\n\nIt was it was quite funny. And it's obviously kind of making fun of this guy. He has some, you know, some redeeming qualities. He's just like a dreamer, you know, good for him.\n\n\nBut it's making fun of the guy. But he doesn't care. He just wants to like he was next to James Franco on stage at the Golden Globes and stuff. He just wants that fame.\n\n\nYeah. He just wants attention. Even if he's the even if he's the nail, he doesn't need to be the hammer.\n\n\nYou know what? The most insulting thing I've gotten is recent. I don't even talk about it. But anyways, I should because it's just funny.\n\n\nYou know, I'm I'm finally at this point in my career, if people sends me scripts, if I want to do it, which is very flattering, I'm like, oh, great.\n\n\nSo there's an email. My agent says is like, are you going to be really angry at this or really happy about it?\n\n\nI was like, oh, fuck. Not a good way to start an email from your agent. And they're like, they want you to play a lead in this biopic. I was like, Oh shit, what's up?\n\n\nYou know, like I'm ready. And then they're like, Yeah, but it's the biopic of William Hung. I was like, Brother, is that the Virginia shooter?\n\n\nNah, nah, nah, nah. Oh, that's that guy's American Idol singer. She bangs motherfucker.\n\n\nOh, I met that dude. Look, nothing wrong with the guy.\n\n\nThere's definitely something wrong with him. Well, yeah, yeah. But yes, yes, yes. But he's not malicious. No, no, no. Maybe a little aschberg or something.\n\n\nI don't know what it is, but I thought it was that that one dude who was a shooter I think versity.\n\n\nYeah. That's tough to I read all 115 pages of that script.\n\n\nI've never been so angry reading a script like I wanted to fucking vomit. And why were you angry?\n\n\nWell, you got to understand, I think William Hung set us back like ten years. Look, nothing wrong with that brother. It's not his fault. Right?\n\n\nMaybe there is a very nuanced way to write this movie of why American Idol producers picked him out of crowd and featured him just to make fun of him and why the rest of America laughed at this guy. That might be an interesting story, but wasn't that the whole thing about American Idol?\n\n\nIt's like you had real talent, but then you also had delusional people and the delusional people was part of the. Oh, it's funny.\n\n\nI love watching that, but I think. Just cut so deep as an Asian guy, it's the opposite of William Hung is the exact opposite of Bush and and but he's there's something wrong with him.\n\n\nI mean, as a human being, like there's something to be like.\n\n\nI get the guy signed a release and I get that that's part of the fun with the show. But there is kind of a difference between people that are mentally challenged and someone who's just not very talented.\n\n\nBut people are laughing at. Exactly. That's what I'm saying is mentally challenged. Something wrong with them? When I say there's nothing wrong with them, I don't mean he's not, you know, autistic, mentally challenged, whatever it may be. I'm saying there's nothing wrong with his intentions. Right.\n\n\nHe's a dreamer. He want to make it right. Right, right.\n\n\nSo there is a very nuanced way to write about William Hung.\n\n\nThat could work, but we just shouldn't make that movie. Have we ran that of Asian people out there that I can do biopics about?\n\n\nAnd fucking William hung a script, lands on my desk.\n\n\nWell, isn't that that's a part of the problem with reality TV in general? Right. It's like what they're trying to do is there's some reality TV that's based on actual events that are taking place. But a lot of it is like they're taking you have to sign these releases on a lot of these shows that allow them to edit your words in a very distorted way. But you can you and I can have a conversation.\n\n\nYou could have an answer to one question, and they'll put that answer on another question that's totally unrelated. You look like a real piece of shit, right.\n\n\nAnd there are 100 percent allowed to do that. Yeah. And they do that for the storyline. They do that for the narrative. They don't care about your reputation. They don't care about what happens when you go back home. People like, how can you fucking say that, Jimi?\n\n\nLike, I didn't have access to the raw tapes you can't release. You know, no one's going to believe you, but that's they victimize people on purpose just so that they can make what they call a good show. Yeah, but they're doing that with him.\n\n\nIt's different because he's got a problem. It's not like he's a guy. Like, it's not like if I decided I was going to be a singer, I went on American America's Got Talent. I was terrible. Yeah. And I'm singing and everybody just they hit the buzzer to get the fuck out of here. Yeah, I'm I can I'm a normal person. Like, if you think I suck, like, I probably suck. Yeah. But if I have a problem, like a mental problem, like there's something wrong with me.\n\n\nYeah. And I do that and you know there's something wrong with me. And you still put me on television. That's where we're getting weird. That's what we're getting like.\n\n\nAre you you're profiting off taking advantage of someone. Yes. Yeah. Yes.\n\n\nYou're profiting off of someone who's clearly mentally handicapped in some some way, shape or form. If there's a spectrum of mental disability, he's on that spectrum. It's not you. It's not Jamie. It's not me.\n\n\nIt's like, oh, he's a regular guy. Yeah. You know, we're all different, but regular, like, you can talk to them. That guy's off somethings, you know, he's off. Yeah.\n\n\nBut they like perfect Ron. It perfect line them up because people like that they know people love.\n\n\nAnd why are people laughing.\n\n\nYou know, I look it's tough being I guess one of few Asian actors in America.\n\n\nRight. I'm very fortunate to be in that position.\n\n\nWe all kind of know each other. It's a small circle. I'm very proud of all of us.\n\n\nBut early on in my career, I got some flack from Silicon Valley, my character, you know, it was accent of character, which I mean, for me it's a little different because I came to this country, I started I couldn't really speak English, so I was like, okay, I'm just going to play an early version of myself.\n\n\nI understand. I'm to try to put some human in his character, but then some articles or whatever. It's like this is an offensive stereotype, blah, blah.\n\n\nAnd that really looked into that. I was like, OK, I get it. Eventually the character became a more three dimensional character because the jokes no longer on him just being foreign. It's on him being like a diabolical coater person.\n\n\nBut it's tough being an Asian actor because now not only do I have to decide on playing a part and not by looking at, oh, is this a good script? I got to look at the cultural ramifications.\n\n\nIs this good representation? Because there are so few of us, each of us, that does something mean so much more? Right. That was the beef with the APU character because there wasn't a lot of Indian. And then you can criticize whatever.\n\n\nNow, that's what's great about this crazy rich Asians.\n\n\nAnd then I had a lot of fun on that movie because for one of the first times, I wasn't the only Asian dude on set. And I can just play a character. My character's an asshole in that movie, but I can just lean into that and be a character actor and play it.\n\n\nAnd it's a powerful, funny movie, great production. It came out excellent. Everybody enjoyed it and that's good.\n\n\nAnd there's a whole spectrum of Asians. It's not just one Asian representing all Asians and handsome Asians, you asshole Asians, the romantic lead and also the bitchy ex-girlfriend or whatever. So we can just actually be actors for the first time and not be actors Asian representative.\n\n\nSo when something like William. Comes to the table. Yeah, I just can't do it, man. I mean, come on, I get it. You know, it's interesting that that it's like when someone gets offended at racial stereotypes, society puts it through this filter of whether or not it's valid. And I'll give you an example.\n\n\nThe Sopranos, the Italian American Anti Defamation League, or whatever the fuck it is, they were pissed at The Sopranos. They're pissed that it was it was reinforcing negative stereotypes about Italians. And I'm Italian and everyone I know that's Italian was like, what the fuck are you talking about?\n\n\nThose are real people. I know guys like that. Yeah, yeah. This is offensive. That's offensive reality. Yeah. Is the mob real? Are those fat guys real? Do they eat pasta like that. Yes, that's real. Yeah. That's not because Italians aren't really discriminated against so it's it doesn't hold any water.\n\n\nWhat also you are Italian.\n\n\nThere's a ton of Italian actors, comedians out there.\n\n\nSo Sopranos is not the only place where you see it. Right. It's not the only presence. So that it down and it's fine.\n\n\nYeah. Because white people, you can play whatever mentally handicapped guy, not so smart guy or complete asshole because there's a million other white people.\n\n\nBut as soon as you play a mentally handicapped car, it's over. That's a very dangerous. But that was Robert Downey Jr..\n\n\nOh, he was Tropic Thunder retard. Never go for Rita. But then he get an Oscar nomination for being in blackface. I hope he did.\n\n\nI mean, he we talked about it on the podcast, and he was it was like, thank God we talked about it on the podcast months ago and we didn't talk about it today because today I wouldn't even bring it up.\n\n\nToday, people are getting the guy who's the fucking editor of Bon Appetit. Yes. They got he got fired for a photograph that he took dressing up like, I guess he's Puerto Rican. Like that was a costume party, dollface or something. Little brown, face it all. Just gold chains and a hat and said the Bronx or something.\n\n\nYeah, yeah. It's I think they said it, they called it racially insensitive.\n\n\nWell, but that was kind of what I was talking about earlier, though. Adam Rapoport, I am a big fan of Bon Appetit until like maybe then and then I got to OK, what's going on here? Because, OK, the news came out with him on that picture, but it's not that picture. And then his staff, there's this girl that was one of the only minorities on camera.\n\n\nShe started saying, yes, I agree, not just that picture, but I'm the only maybe non-white person on camera that's not getting paid fairly.\n\n\nThey just want to push me on camera for diversity.\n\n\nBut I get paid fractions of whatever the other pay. And then even other white people spoke up and be like, yeah, we have some systematic stuff here we should look into.\n\n\nOh, at the yeah. At the organization. Yeah. So it's like so it's a combination. Yeah.\n\n\nSo if I have a Puerto Rican picture of me, I don't think people would start jumping on me and be like, yeah, he is kind of a dick.\n\n\nBut here's example. If someone had a picture of them pretending to be Italian, nobody would give a fuck. If he had a tank top on with spaghetti stains on it and his hair greased back, no one would give a fuck.\n\n\nThe problem may be that there's not enough representation in a positive way of Puerto Ricans in the media because like you have a who's like who are the there's a lot of famous Puerto Ricans. Yeah. Like who?\n\n\nWho are give me examples of I don't want to get the wrong nationality with famous actors, but I'm very aware that there's a lot of famous Puerto Ricans, but maybe not enough maybe because it's maybe so maybe it's the timing of immigration.\n\n\nLike my grandparents, when they came here, I talked to my grandfather a lot about it. They were horribly abused. There was a lot of racism against Italians when they were initially immigrated in the early nineteen hundreds.\n\n\nBut by the time I was a kid, it was gone. I mean, I experienced a little bit of it in Boston and with Irish kids, it would make fun of me for being Italian or shit on me for being Italian. But by the time I was a grown man, it's still like that. Kind of like a..\n\n\nItalian racism is non-existent, basically, because it's like just white, kind of it's like covid in Italy right now.\n\n\nIt's you can't even find it like you see the new CDC, they were talking about a covid, like the the the viral load in Italy right now.\n\n\nSo small it's barely registering. Oh, wow.\n\n\nReally? Yeah. Because they were rough.\n\n\nThey had it rough. Yeah. They're not healthy. Again, these are my people. They fucking EPOs to drink wine. They all smoke cigarettes, they live on top of each other. No one's washing their hands. Yeah. There's no exercise. Try. I was just having this conversation with Sebastian yesterday. We were joking around about this.\n\n\nHe's like try finding a fucking good German and Italian hotel.\n\n\nAnd it's totally true. Every time I'd go there, I'd be like some cable machine with some fucked up pulley system that's broken. And I just want to be doing push ups and sit ups and just run up the rocks or something like there's no gyms, like the gym is a joke.\n\n\nNo one over there is working out what the thing is.\n\n\nI don't think I want to say that. Or I could say that I can't just do a bit about Italians not having gyms and being fat. Right.\n\n\nBut Sebastian Maniscalco. Yeah, no, no, but I can do that. But I'm saying you can do that. But you could do we wouldn't give a fuck.\n\n\nNo one can.\n\n\nSomebody what you and Sebastian wouldn't but somebody nice people are assholes, whoever. Would it be like those Italian American anti defamation people that got mad at The Sopranos, like, shut up.\n\n\nThere's no anti I mean, the anti Italian sentiment in this country is so small. It's you can't even measure it. It's a it doesn't count. You can't complain. You can't complain where you see what Asian people have to go through. Black people have to go through. Mexican people have to go through. Muslim people have to go. You can't complain if you're Italian. Yeah, you can. It's ridiculous.\n\n\nYeah. You know, Lonzo Bolton set this jokingly to me after you know, my seconds.\n\n\nMy said has a lot of Asian stuff, my stories, you know, and some complaints and then he's like, you know, I like how are you talking about race because you got minor inconveniences.\n\n\nBlack people get shot, you know. And I was like, oh shit, shit, I never talk. But he's a friend. He was joking to the point, you know, but that's kind of what you're saying. You know, it's a point.\n\n\nIt's a real good point. But, yeah. Is it weird that we have, like hierarchies of racial discrimination in this country, you know, hierarchies, and then there's there's like positive racial stereotypes, right.\n\n\nBlack guys, big dicks, Asian guys, good at math.\n\n\nAre those OK? Like, are those stereotypes OK?\n\n\nApparently not. I don't think I don't think it is.\n\n\nI it's I wonder when as a culture will I mean, I really honestly believe this and I'm one of those I'm a forever optimist.\n\n\nI really believe that this moment, the reason why these people are in the streets, the reason why there's a take away, the looting, just the peaceful protests.\n\n\nThe reason why all this is happening is because. There's a lot of parts of our culture that haven't caught up to the Zygi used to the way people feel about things, the way people are disgusted by racism, the way people are disgusted by discrimination, and then people are united and getting together to try to show that like it's a cultural shift that's represented by this mass movement of human beings.\n\n\nI think it's I think every if you follow, like Steven Pinker's work, where he talks about violence and if you go back and look at crime 100 hundred years ago versus now, you see this very steady decrease in crime and violence and people getting better.\n\n\nWe're getting better at everything. And I feel like this is a cultural moment where people are going to get better at racism.\n\n\nYeah, I hope so. Not better.\n\n\nAnd doing it better yet to be sneakier at it. You know, I mean, really about better just we're all humans, man. And the only differences is, you know, that we came from different climates. And to pay attention to that and focus on that above all else, it's just it's so it's it's annoying.\n\n\nYeah, it's dumb. It's just it's an artifact of the past, you know.\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\nAnd I wanted to get to the point where you can make fun of everybody and no one gives a fuck.\n\n\nWell, yeah, it's just fun. And also you want to like like when I talk to my black friends, I'm not asking them, yo man, tell me about Black Lives Matter.\n\n\nEducate me or whatever. Like we're past that. Like when I'm talking, I'm talking about girls, you know, like the right life. But I think when you're uncomfortable, that's when you're like, hey yo.\n\n\nSo you're Italian. Like, imagine if that's my conversation. That's weird. Like if you come up to me, I walk in the store and the first thing you ask me is Asian shit like, did you learn to use chopsticks?\n\n\nYeah, we're not friends. Like, we're just the you know, you're just I'm your Asian consultant. So I think. Right. Yeah. It's good to get past that point where.\n\n\nSure. We can just talk about anything that's beyond that.\n\n\nBut yeah, there is so much work to be done. I think there's it's what's happening is is very it's a great turning point. We look be like, yeah, there's great things happening.\n\n\nAnd then there's also the feeding frenzy. The like the the online mob feeding frenzy is happening to this like this whole broad range of things that are happening all at once.\n\n\nAnd there's great things and bad things.\n\n\nBut that's just part of being human. Like you have to see the bad things and just go, this is fucking gross. Like, let's get away from this and this is better. And then you see, you know, like when when people see things that give them hope and you see all those little heart signs or people love things and like things and say, this is amazing. And then they share it and reposted and retweeted. It's like that's it's it's spread through people.\n\n\nWe should all be looking for more things that make us feel good, whether it's our own actions or things that we can find online, like more things that like that resonate with how we want the world to be.\n\n\nYeah. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely. And. Yeah, I mean, I don't I don't have anything to endlessness and, well, I mean, that makes you feel good.\n\n\nAll those things are good and dick for the ladies and the gay folks, folks and pussy for the ladies that are into ladies.\n\n\nSo the conclusion of that entire conversation index. Good. I should do porn. That's that's what we're saying.\n\n\nThat to you taken away in a subtle way. OK, the past hour and a half hour. Reconsider. I'm going to redo it. Yeah, I could.\n\n\nWell, you don't you don't know my my my day game. You don't know my dear game.\n\n\nI've heard your jokes about your dick game, so I'm assuming your dick game's pretty good.\n\n\nI got to represent bro. I got to do it. I got to do a dick game show, you know, to represent tattoo this shit.\n\n\nYeah. Do you feel like comedy has less opportunities for Asian guys. Stand up in itself.\n\n\nYeah. Stand up. I think I look at stand up as such a utopia.\n\n\nI have such a love for it because it's, it's a meritocracy. It is a meritocracy. And the weirder you are, the less fitting in are in society, the better you probably going to be. You have an angle.\n\n\nAnd when I first started I was able to do some say improv, improbable, whatever shows that I would never have gotten to do one year in because they were Asian shows.\n\n\nSo I was able to fit something, you know, so.\n\n\nSo that it could be could be. I always say this. I think it's it could be easier if you have an angle, whereas it's a race thing or something, some specialty of yours to get into acting, to get into comedy. But when you get to a certain level it becomes less work I think.\n\n\nMm. Interesting. Yeah, like gives you an angle to break in, but once you've broken in, then it might not be.\n\n\nI've had conversations with my female friends about stand up female friends that are comics about stand up and the ones that are really good all seem to think it's a meritocracy. And the ones that are not very good seem to think there's some discrimination.\n\n\nInteresting. Yeah. The one you talked to, Ali Wong, Ali Wong and I had a conversation about it and I'm and she goes, Do you think it's a meritocracy? I go, I do.\n\n\nShe I do too. I think it's because, like, look, she's fucking murder in it, right? Killing Caitlyn absolutely smashed. She did like some insane number of sold out shows in San Francisco. She's a beast. She's there's no denying that. Right.\n\n\nAlso a woman. And but there's other women that will tell you, like it's hard for women to get on the lineup's. It's hard for women to get promoted.\n\n\nI'm like, OK, mate, I think it's harder for women to go on stage. It's harder for first of all, if a woman goes on stage and does stand up almost automatically her politically, her political opinions. Nobody wants to hear. Men don't want to hear your political opinions. Men don't want to hear you telling them things that they don't already know. Men don't want you to like if you talk about sex, like men like you've got to be like a broken, slutty kind of a girl to talk about sex on stage and then they'll go with it.\n\n\nBut if you just like a regular girl with no problems and you want to talk about sex, it's like your you get scrutinized.\n\n\nI think. So you have to be better. You have to I think, like for a woman to like, write like a Whitney Cummings or allies or someone to, like, rise through the ranks. You have to be undeniable. You have to be able to go into any crowd and slay, you know, and but some women along that process of like figuring out that there's a sort of a narrow window that you can fit your jokes through in the beginning at least, they stumble into that and they bounce off those walls and they don't they don't get like a guy can like right away, talk about politics, talk about sex, talk about anything for men.\n\n\nIt just has to be funny. It's basically wide open. But men discriminate. A lot of men do not want to generalize. A lot of men discriminate.\n\n\nWhen they see a woman go on stage, they go, oh, great. A woman comic. Some woman, I don't know. Right, you're going to suck. Are you going to talk about politics? Shut the fuck up. I didn't want it.\n\n\nLike some men don't want to hear a woman talk. Yeah, that's tough, man.\n\n\nSo I thought about that. Women have to be better.\n\n\nAnd I guess.\n\n\nDo you think it's harmful or is it helpful to start in that narrow lane, whereas it's a girl talking about dirty sex stuff or an Asian comic talking about being Asian and then you can expand to other jokes?\n\n\nWell, I think we all start with training wheels. Yes. I mean, we all talk about jerking off in our first five minutes.\n\n\nYou have to. Yeah, well, how old were you when you started? Stand up. Twenty one. You me too. Yeah. I didn't know anything. I was a moron. Like, sex was the only thing that I was even interested in. So that's all I talked about on stage. Right. You know, and I don't just surviving.\n\n\nYeah. Yeah. Whatever. You can get a laugh. You know how you do it. Yeah.\n\n\nI think it's harder for women in the beginning. Parts are harder and harder. It's harder to do that. It's harder to just you can't just talk about sex. I think they have to be a little more undeniable. They're a little more scrutinized. And again, a lot of it is like men don't necessarily a lot of men, again, I'm generalizing, don't necessarily want to hear a woman on stage. See, there's a thing about stand, too, like like you're a smooth guy when you're on stage.\n\n\nI love your delivery, your presentation. Very easy to watch, very casual. But because of that, because you're so comfortable, it gives you the illusion that anyone can do it right.\n\n\nBecause you're just talking right.\n\n\nI can talk to you. I can go up there and do what he's doing. I know how to talk. He's talking. I can talk.\n\n\nI'm going to do standup. Yeah. And so it gives it gives so dopey men already think they can do what you do.\n\n\nAnd when a woman does it be men that are sexist automatically think they can do better than that woman and they don't want to hear.\n\n\nHuh. Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's an easy it's like acting. It's like acting seems easy just being myself, just talking. They don't know the writing that puts into it like for us comics and then the training for actors.\n\n\nIt's not like we're driving an airplane, you know, or flying an airplane.\n\n\nBut when you get to like Daniel Day Lewis style of acting like pitch, you can't do that. You stop pretending you could do that. You get to like my left foot or some of the crazy shit that he did.\n\n\nYou know, I would say something about acting. There are naturals like Gennevilliers. Never take an acting class.\n\n\nShe's probably crazy as fuck. Who knows? That's what I would say. Yeah. Just really good at at at something. Whatever the skill sending at pretending and lying something. Right. And you just really good a really good at knowing the human condition somehow.\n\n\nYeah. But comedians, even if you're a fucking natural you suck in the first five years.\n\n\nYou suck. You suck. I mean, you might get a copy seeing anyone, but just like immediately good, some guys that have gone through Alcoholics Anonymous are really good right off the bat because that's like their stage training.\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a few that I knew back in Boston who's well, quite a few guys actually in Boston started out in AA. But this guy, Dave Fitzgerald, and I remember he was a grown man when I was a boy. I was like twenty one and he was, you know, late 30s and that's when he was starting stand up. But he was way advanced because he just had this ability because he would do the he was an alcoholic for years.\n\n\nSo he would he had these great fucking stories of all the times he did Coke and drank so much that he didn't remember what he was doing and, you know, got arrested and he would tell these crazy drug fueled stories on stage at an AA meeting and people be dying laughing.\n\n\nAnd he had this sort of way of doing it. And then I believe it was I forget who the comic was. It was in the audience. It was also when they grabbed him and said, hey, man, you ever thought about doing standup? You're fucking funny. You could do standup because he was killing at AA meetings.\n\n\nSo then so then when he would go to work, you got to think it's stage time. Yeah. Hi, my name's Dave and he had this like, crazy raspy voice. He had a hard life, Boston accent, hard life.\n\n\nAnd it's a funny fucking dude. And he would go on stage at a comedy club the way he would go on stage at an AA meeting and murder. So he was he was he was killing real way before me killing real early on because he had months of standup, maybe even years.\n\n\nI'm not sure how long he had done the AA meetings before he actually got on stage at a club. But he he had an advantage. Yeah. Yeah. There's still stage time.\n\n\nYeah. It's like he's been doing open mikes for five months.\n\n\nAlso super supportive, open mic nights like. Hi, my name's Dave. I'm an alcoholic. Hi, Dave. Yeah. You know, everyone is there with you. Get a little more comfortable, get loose and you're around a bunch of other fellow junkies. You fucked up their lives. Yeah. Yeah. You know what's interesting, like speaking, I like being supportive.\n\n\nComics were very like we make fun of each other. That's what we do. Yes. It's like you walk off a stage like the first like if you bomb and you walk on stage, like we're doing a fucking One-Man show.\n\n\nYeah. You know, it's just in a way now it's a compliment. If you can do one man show you Kaelyn, but we just break each other's backs. Right. But I remember the first time I took improv classes, I was so uncomfortable because everybody's so supportive.\n\n\nYou know, that subsume, what, a three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Let's do these exercises and shit. And then I was like, oh, my God.\n\n\nIf my buddy Taurel saw me doing this, I would I not. Oh, my God, I would not hear the end of it, you know. But there's something really nice about that. When you get to a certain level in acting or when you get over yourself as a standup, you want to you should be around supportive people.\n\n\nYeah. Once you get to a certain level. But then when people bust balls, like if someone gets off stage and has a terrible set and their friend bust their balls, usually they laugh, they like to eat shit.\n\n\nYou ain't played this shit. So you have a drink and there's laughter.\n\n\nIt's like there's there's there's fun to it. It's like they're they're picking up your spirits by making fun of you.\n\n\nAnd then you get to laugh at that. And like we all know, it's a process. You trust the process. And one of the things you have a special that's out right now. Yeah. On Amazon is it right now. Right, right. Right, right, right.\n\n\nYou come out. When did it come out? It came out two weeks ago, I think. OK, beautiful.\n\n\nSo when did you film this November. Oh, you got in pretty early.\n\n\nYeah. Yeah. It's funny I start my set by saying Asian's. We had a couple of good years. I guess not so true anymore.\n\n\nYou know, after the whole covid they got in right before covid became gigantic news.\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was pretty tough, I mean before or so. So the special came out. What in me. Yeah. Early May and I was, I was kind of kicking myself. I was like shit. If it would have been later my whole material would have changed like blah blah. But it's like good to kind of have that out there.\n\n\nYes.\n\n\nAnd have people kind of see a glimpse of how good life was maybe six months ago, you know, like you're positive it was because now it would have been a little more somber tone, I think.\n\n\nYeah, it's hard now. I mean, it's hard to figure out like what to say. It's going to it's going to take a while for everything to, like, settle in the place where people can accept even what's happened. I mean, how many people you're dealing with in the audience that have lost their job. The only people you're dealing with, you know, there's no job for that doesn't exist anymore. Their business is gone. Yeah. And they just want to laugh and like, maybe there's some wounds that you don't want to scratch that we're going to have to navigate those weird waters.\n\n\nYeah, I don't know. Like, when we go back, do we open with talking about covid and quarantine? Because that's what's on everybody's mind that we talk about some totally different.\n\n\nI think I'm going to not talk about covid.\n\n\nI might talk about the the the riots fascinate me because it's what I've always said, like people have said to me, like, why do you have. Guns like, why are you in the self-defense, like why, you know, something like civilization is a thin veneer, like we have only been civilized for the last 10000 years or so. Before that, we were fucking barbarians for hundreds of thousands of years. We have that same DNA of those barbarians.\n\n\nIt's in our blood.\n\n\nAnd we keep it together with religion and societal norms and and community and love and friendship. But when things go sideways, you get to see what people are really capable of. And that's what we saw during the looting, in the riots, when people have an excuse and a reason, particularly when people are backed into a corner because they couldn't work for three months. And then there's a justification the system is fucked up. This guy that killed that, the cop that killed that guy is a piece of shit.\n\n\nThere's there's riots and then you see cops that are fucking shooting tear gas at people and you're like, fuck you. They just want to smash and loot.\n\n\nYou see that thin layer of what a what a human being really is.\n\n\nThe civilization veneer gets removed and you go, oh, look at the real the real thing under there is an animal. Humans are animals. We're weird talking animal that and we want to survive. And we have ideas of fairness and rules and and and we have a mob mentality. There's a weird thing that will happen that it's probably built into us from thousands of years of surviving hand-to-hand combat in war. When shit goes crazy around, you lock into chaos mode.\n\n\nAnd if you've ever been around a mob like that's going crazy and nutty, you can feel it, man.\n\n\nYou feel it in your skin. You feel it in the air.\n\n\nI'm fascinated by that. And I'm probably going to talk about that.\n\n\nAnd you're the most prepared guy. If some shit comes to shit, you can fight. You got you got weapons.\n\n\nBut I'm the be the first to get the fuck out of here, too. I'm the last to stay and fight. I'm like, get the fuck out of here. You can't win this. Yeah. This is not a winnable situation. This is not a home invasion. This is this is the world going sideways. Like you've got to get the fuck out.\n\n\nHow does it feel to be a martial arts expert, somebody that can fight? Like, do you feel more confident going outside to you?\n\n\nLike, you know, because I'm always looking around like, OK, make sure that guy doesn't fuck me up. He can even totally kill me, like, you know, whatever.\n\n\nPeople can always shoot you. They can always shoot you, stab you, they can always hit you over the head. You're not looking. There's always danger in being a person, especially when you're around bad people. Right. But if I'm in a situation where some guy's a dick.\n\n\nAnd, you know, I think like I've seen people get beat up, man, that couldn't defend themselves and it's horrible to watch. It's sad. I mean, we've seen many videos online of people just getting beat up by somebody. Yeah. Because they don't know how to fight. And you see, some person really doesn't even know how to fight and they're beating the fuck out of someone and hurting them really bad.\n\n\nYeah, that's not going to happen to me. Huh. I like that.\n\n\nI like that of some asshole tries to do that to me. I can I can hurt them. I can detain them. I can I could submit them. Yeah. But it doesn't ever get to that point.\n\n\nHave you have you gotten in fights lately. I'm not a fighter. I mean I know how to do it, but I'm a nice person.\n\n\nSo it's just knowing that having a self-confidence feels powerful, then it stops.\n\n\nYeah, but there's a lot of sketchy people out there, man. We've all seen videos and I watched a video yesterday of some guy punching some girl in the face for like no reason and knocking her unconscious.\n\n\nI'm like, what the fuck? People are assholes.\n\n\nThere's a bunch of people that are abused and they come from horrible backgrounds. They're abused by their parents or their family.\n\n\nAnd they're they're a mess.\n\n\nAnd they they walk amongst us free until they commit crimes and they get locked in jail.\n\n\nSo if somebody wants to fight me what I do, I just run. I get the fuck out of that, bro.\n\n\nYou got to see it coming. Seeing it coming is real. That's a real important part of it. Like seeing it coming right away, seeing sketchy people, knowing you got to have that Spidey sense. You're going to get the fuck out of there. But it's exciting to be around danger.\n\n\nThat's for you, not me.\n\n\nIt's exciting to be in weird areas and be around weird people.\n\n\nIt's like when things are a little bit a little sketchy, a little seedy. People enjoy that is like a it's like what do you what would you rather have?\n\n\nWould you rather have everything be fucking boring and vanilla and just write everything is Hermosa Beach or you know, every now and then you want something to be just a little bit fucking dirty.\n\n\nIt makes you feel alive when you do the shitty mike. So like random spots here and there, there's a grittiness to it.\n\n\nYeah, I think especially standups, we really gravitate to that.\n\n\nYeah. I think feels like we like a little danger. Yeah. We also like what you're doing when you're doing standup as you kind of exposing these truths that everybody kind of knows about but doesn't talk about.\n\n\nAnd it frees them in a way like. Yes, yes.\n\n\nLike there's like there's thoughts that are there there.\n\n\nBut you got to unearth them. You got to dust them off and show them to people and like, yes, yeah, this is a danger to that. Right. There's a riskiness to what we do.\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\nFor sure. There's something it's a weird job, man, and everybody does a different right. You get the Hedberg. He does it. Mitch does did it one way. You do it a different way. Joey Diaz does it a different way. Everyone's got a different way of doing it. But it's ultimately you're trying to find those points, find that those perspectives find use those comedy weapons to pop through on these people and break into their mind and get those sparks flying.\n\n\nWhat do you think separates a good comic to like the next level? Great comic? There's a lot of things.\n\n\nI think it's really dependent upon the person, but I think a lot of it is focusing on comedy and like really working on your shit and making sure you're you're you're a real objective about what you're doing.\n\n\nAlso, a lot of reps, man. Yeah. Putting in a lot of reps. Reps are giant man.\n\n\nYeah, I think that's there's no no denying that. And then also different things that you do.\n\n\nOne of the things that I do is I, I do stand up. I listen to that stand up and then I write, I write on stage, I listen to my sets, I write off stage and I mean, I write on stage. And like, I've come up with ideas of free ball. You take chances on stage. But then I sit down and I write right. I sit down in front of a computer for hours. Wow.\n\n\nAnd every now and then I'll sit down maybe for four hours and I'll come up with like one line. But it's worth but that's one line I would have never gotten. Yeah. Some of those lines, like the best lines in my act, came from me just sitting in front of a computer.\n\n\nYeah. Just writing.\n\n\nJust it's it's a constantly I guess the the danger and the fear fearlessness of comics is also the willingness to try new shit.\n\n\nYeah. Four pages. No shit that maybe only one line works because I know many people that I came up with that much funnier than me naturally I think.\n\n\nBut they, they are stuck in that fifteen you know, they keep going at fifteen because they feel good.\n\n\nThat's their drug. That's, that's the fifteen minutes to get to go away from their wife and have fun. Yeah. So they won't want to risk that and have a shitty night.\n\n\nRight. They want to kill you. Love that feeling of killing. Yeah. And that's what I was getting out earlier. Like one of the things about like you just did a special one of the exciting things about comedy is we all become beginners. After we do a special, you do a special and then you start from scratch. You're a beginner again.\n\n\nSo like I know you're a great comic. I know you're. Really funny, but if I see you and you're eating shit, I'm going to laugh at you because I know you're good, I'm like, dude, this new shit's rough. Yeah, and we all would be laughing. We'd be like, oh, ha ha. It'd be fun. We could laugh together at pain. I'm still insecure.\n\n\nI'm still insecure in a way that. OK, sure. I got to go write some new shit now. And the hit in a weird point.\n\n\nNow I can't come up with new shit because we can't go to comedy clubs. Oh.\n\n\nSo I'm kind of stuck. We're all going to be beginners, all of us.\n\n\nBut I'm still afraid that even though I don't need another acting job from somebody watching me and standup, I don't need to impress a manager in the audience or another. There's still an insecurity like I don't want to tank in case somebody I like is watching me for the first time.\n\n\nYeah. I mean, but that's where alcohol comes in. Yeah. Shot of Jack, hit of a joint and just fuck and let the good times roll.\n\n\nWell I guess you can't think about it because imagine that time you just walked by and saw me in the lap for the first time and I just had a dick, you know, like I won't be like everybody dick in the club.\n\n\nYeah, that's true. But like, he's eating a dick just like I have. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I don't know if that ever goes away.\n\n\nI know what you mean, but the there's like the thought process of like well you should work out your shit at the ha ha or the White House or flappers a little bit off the beaten path.\n\n\nYou don't want to do it at the Improv. You don't want to do at the store. I disagree.\n\n\nI disagree. You have to. You have to. You have to be taking chances. You have to swing.\n\n\nI'd takechi flopped at the store a bunch of times or pull out a joke that I have like roughly in my head. But it's also preparation's important to like you got to, I think, even want to have a new bit. Like I just sometimes I'll go up with a just a seed sometimes and like, no, I need like a plant that I could like just dig a hole and shove that in there.\n\n\nI need a full plant. Yeah. I mean, yeah, but it's really dependent upon the subject matter. Like I remember when the Harvey Weinstein shit broke, I had a bit that night. I'm like right away. I'm like, oh I know my angle. My angle is that if Harvey Weinstein did that to my daughter, I would I found out that I was sexist because if Harvey Weinstein did that to my daughter, I would fucking kill him.\n\n\nBut if Harvey Weinstein came to my son with a solid contract, I'd be like, Dude, you're going to be Batman.\n\n\nRight, right, right, right, right.\n\n\nYou know, and I had this whole bit that blossomed that night, like that line, dude, you're going to be Batman. That came the first night on stage because it was like right when he was getting arrested. I was like, wow. And I was like, how would I feel if that was a woman that was like this disgusting woman that was like Harvey Weinstein in a dress that was trying to fuck my son.\n\n\nI'd be like, oh, yeah, yeah. Come on. Do you think working in a coal mine is fun? You got to do what you got to do to get by in this world. Yeah, come on, pussy.\n\n\nAnd in that that bit became a bit like it blossomed on stage.\n\n\nI just had a seed. I just had an idea.\n\n\nThe best feeling that's like you freestyle.\n\n\nIt's amazing because it was like hours after he was arrested. It was like hours after it went down. Yeah. And it just it just it just popped. And then it became a bit that I wrote and I worked on it and I you know, I honed it on stage.\n\n\nBut LDAP it was just that was was just a seed. But then there's other bits that, like, they took a lot of real thinking and like this is like these are mine field terrain.\n\n\nYeah. Yeah. I'm going through here.\n\n\nI got to make sure, I make sure that I really got all my I's and cross all my T's when I'm talking about this, because this is a controversial subject. I want I don't want anybody to misconstrue what I'm saying here.\n\n\nRight, right, right, right, right. Yeah. That's also the tough part, the message that you're sending, because that's beyond just being funny. Oh, yes. You got to be responsible at that point. And yeah, it's really hard.\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\nYou want to like, say if you're doing a joke and some in the joke, you reference gay people you want like if there's a gay couple in the audience, you want those folks to know you love them.\n\n\nLike I don't have any zero animosity to anybody.\n\n\nLike I love gay people. I love straight, I love everybody.\n\n\nBut I'm going to make fun of you. Yeah, I'm going to make fun of something that I that something that gay people do. But I want you to know there's got to be a way that I want you to know before I do this.\n\n\nThis is not homophobic. Yeah. Yeah. If I'm saying this, I'm saying this just because it's funny, we're all funny. So I have to figure out a way to navigate those waters.\n\n\nDo you. I guess what I try to do now, especially with the landscape of the standup comedy specials, I see someone, the one that really pop and I like it, where a lot of it, like Hassan Monogamists or Hannah Gatsby's not.\n\n\nFunny in that sense, Hannah gasps say right, like a lot of comics. It like a TED talk. Yeah, but I think there's a point that I think that's cool that actually gets a message across. So I always try to her thing is probably like maybe 50 percent tech talk and 50 percent comedy.\n\n\nIf that I try to do like 80 percent comedy and then maybe 20 percent. I'm just telling a story that's a bit, you know, like I have a story where I almost got deported a couple of times, you know, when I was being an idiot.\n\n\nIt's not it's not that funny.\n\n\nBut there was some kind of a point to it. Right.\n\n\nBut you're like a pure comic. You're like a hundred percent standup like that one man show stuff.\n\n\nBecause I was I've trouble to see, like, am I am I kind of being a sellout here by doing that?\n\n\nYou know, no, I don't think it's been a sellout. Look, people obviously like Hannah Gatsby. Look, I had this conversation with comics about it. Like I thought it was weird when they were trying to say that she's redefining comedy or uncommon in comedy like.\n\n\nNo, no, you're not. No, you're not. This is what you're doing. You're doing your thing. You're things like people are enjoying. It's resonating. It's huge. Yeah.\n\n\nSo her thing people are enjoying it doesn't invalidate ignore it or invalidate Donelle Williams, Donau Rollins or or Harland Williams.\n\n\nI was going to say or you know, who's like totally silly. You know, Harlan Williams is just completely silly or is just wild and loud and that's great too.\n\n\nOr, you know, good, good thing. Joey Diaz, it's like it's not invalidating Joey Diaz saying validating people that also do a different thing that people love as well. It's just you're doing something where you're talking about you're like Hannah Gadsby's talking about her own pain, right? She's talking about her own issues. She's talking about her own life. And it resonates because it's honest and it's real. It doesn't have to be funny. The people that enjoy it, maybe they don't want to just see up.\n\n\nThey want to see something. They want to see something interesting. Mm hmm. But if you go see Daniel Wrong's, he's just going wild. He's having fun. Yeah, that's comedy. Yeah, it's wild comedy. That's OK too. Yeah. All things are ok al madrigal's ok. Everything's OK. It's like different genres of movie.\n\n\nRight. But people will get weird you know. Do they get hateful, angry. Like you know I only like blues music. This rock and roll bullshit.\n\n\nThat's really what it's like. That is, that is what it is. Like I've said I've heard people say that about Harlan Williams is one reason why I brought up Harlan.\n\n\nIt's like he's so silly. And if you saw Harlan on paper, you'd be like, what is that? Hey there, butternut flapjack. Peachy pie. Yeah, man, you would have done it set. I would not work. I would eat shit. Yeah.\n\n\nEvery time I'd quit comedy like that. Yeah. But Harlan there is something about his delivery and that's what he really thinks is funny and it's like you can't tell me it's not funny. I watch him kill. Oh he's amazing. Amazing. Yeah. Right. So like that's his way. And then you know, you've got John Mulaney that's he's got a different way. It's also very good. Yeah. And then you've got Anthony Jeselnik, who's just mean with great writing.\n\n\nRight.\n\n\nBut it's also very good. It's his way. Yeah. There's a bunch of different ways to do this thing. And for one person to decide, like, oh, Hannah Gadsby's real comedy Comedy's Dead, she just killed comedy like, you don't know, comedy and you should just shut the fuck up. Right. Because what you're saying is nonsense. That's like saying rap music killed Beethoven. It's what you're saying is dumb.\n\n\nMm hmm. Yeah. Yeah, that's great.\n\n\nThat's that's how fucking comedy or whatever it is. Yeah. Mean it's comedy too. It's not comedy, you know, it's it's comedy until you decide to tell a story that's not funny. But it's also interesting. Yeah.\n\n\nEven within standup itself, there's so many different genres.\n\n\nThere's no wrong. I love that.\n\n\nYeah. One hundred percent. Yeah. I mean one of the things I always loved about Hedberg is that like it's so absurd and that's not my style of comedy, but it's so silly and absurd.\n\n\nSteven Wright, same thing. Yeah. Non sequitur after non sequitur. Bizarre. Weird.\n\n\nI used to work at a fire hydrant factory, couldn't park anywhere near the place like that kind of comedy.\n\n\nNow, I would never write a joke like that, but with him, with his bizarre look and his bizarre style murders, you know, I didn't know about standup comedy when I was growing up.\n\n\nNever heard of it really, because I grew up in Hong Kong. We didn't understand what you saw.\n\n\nBet comic view. Wow. When I was thirteen one who was I think it was Jay Anthony Brown that year of Bruce Bruce around then.\n\n\nIt was so interesting to me because this wasn't even an art form that existed in my childhood in Hong Kong. I'm sure there were some stand ups.\n\n\nYou never heard of it, never heard of it. Never heard it. And I came to America and I was trying to learn English just by watching TV. And then it seems like just completely different genres in this new art form. It's like I heard music for the first time and I was like, holy shit, this rock and roll music.\n\n\nAnd there's, you know.\n\n\nHip hop, so, so interesting, because I remember I really gravitated towards Comic View that was so interesting because it wasn't just jokes or me trying to learn English, it was me also trying to like learning about culture, how each race saw each other, blah, blah, even though there were stereotypes, you know, that they're joking about.\n\n\nBut it was cool.\n\n\nWhereas I watch a Comedy Central premium blend didn't really laugh.\n\n\nI don't know what I like. So I always gravitated towards one urban comedy, you know, and and.\n\n\nWell, they're having more fun. Yeah, exactly.\n\n\nBut because I was watching the performance of it, it's like there's hip hop fans that like a song because of a beat. And then there's hip hop fans that don't care about the beat and only listen to the lyrics.\n\n\nI was more like the beat guy, you know, and I just love that sort of performance.\n\n\nAnd then only later on when I got into comedy, I was like, oh, wow, everyone that's doing that premium blend stuff, maybe not my cup of tea, but it made me laugh like as an adult because I understood how hard that was.\n\n\nMm hmm. Yeah, I found out about comedy from my parents, took me to see Richard Pryor live at the Sunset Strip when I was 15.\n\n\nMm. In the movie theater, watching Richard Pryor on stage going, oh, this is crazy. I couldn't believe how funny was a guy had seen all these funny movies. But to watch this guy just talking on stage, I was fascinated. He's one of those guys.\n\n\nWhen you watch you like I can do that because he's just talking. He just did he write this? But there's so much insane talent like Michael Jordan makes basketball look easy.\n\n\nBut I mean, I guess sort of, you know, you can't you can't dunk. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n\nThere's there's so many different ways you can get introduced to comedy. It's it's I love hearing, like, when people like when the seed get planted in people's heads, like when did you know that you were going to try to do this.\n\n\nPeople asked me that question and I hear like great stories like the Richard Pryor story. Like it's like me and my brother. He's a snake in a movie theater. Watch Eddie Murphy live after you had heart attack.\n\n\nI promise I'll be a comedian like, really, you know, amazing. I don't have that.\n\n\nI was I think it was a desperation that made me want to do comedy desperation.\n\n\nI never thought that was even a thing. Right. Like because you don't go in the arts when you're Asian, that's not a real job, you know.\n\n\nSo is it because your family would discourage it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And also, nobody in my family did it in the arts, like anybody that made money was in finance, whatever real jobs, quote unquote, you know.\n\n\nSo I, I was just I was about to graduate college with an economics degree and I hated the internship I had in finance and shit.\n\n\nAnd I just saw my life flash in front of me. I'm like, oh my God, for the next 40 years I'm behind this desk, fucking mutual funds, who cares? You know? So I just tried.\n\n\nI like a quarter life crisis, right? When I was about to graduate, I was like, I got to do something to meet new friends, to meet girls, to whatever.\n\n\nSo then I took jujitsu classes for like two months.\n\n\nHorrible. I was I was the smallest guy and the weakest guy in the class now teaming up with the girls. And they would twist me up like a pretzel is very discouraging. I quit after like two months if that. And then I tried like different things, like boxing classes, gyms, whatever, you know. And then. I say the story, I wrote this book and I say in the book, like typing in local open mikes in your Google search, it's one step away from typing in what's the best way to kill myself.\n\n\nIt is that desperation that you need, that I need it. So then I just Google.\n\n\nOK, open mikes wanted a ha ha paid five dollars. You have to pay five dollars for five minutes to stage something haha.\n\n\nSo five other comics can not laugh at you.\n\n\nIt was, you know, horrific, but that still felt better than me sitting at home making no friends because I saw a camaraderie.\n\n\nI was like if I'm good I can make some friends like here in the open mike and there's a new world out.\n\n\nThere's an out for me so soon after I think I quit that finance internship, very promising internship and I just try to do standup.\n\n\nYou know, I did everything. I worked at Door I at the Comedy Palace in San Diego, this Greek restaurant. I'll turn into a comedy club at night. I work the door, folded envelopes, did everything. If they let me sleep that I would have slept, answer the phones and everything.\n\n\nI just dove into it not just for the love of comedy in the arts, but for the love of this new life. This is a new fraternity that I found.\n\n\nOh, you know, that's awesome. So. So a lot of it it was an improvement on my life that was that interested me in stand up and through stand up.\n\n\nI got laid for the first time, you know, I mean, so like it worked out for me and I kind of had a crisis where, OK, I'm doing fine.\n\n\nYou know, I've a lot of friends now. I have you know, I go on dates like it's fine, like my life is fine.\n\n\nAnd I started making money on Silicon Valley, you know, so I stopped doing standup.\n\n\nI was like, I don't really need this, you know, but but then after, like, I wasn't getting the press either.\n\n\nSo it was a really good feeling because it wasn't a crutch.\n\n\nIt wasn't an addiction I need to feed. And then eventually I did stand up. Finally, I think for the love of it, I was like, you know what, I do miss this.\n\n\nI'm going to go do it on my own terms, not just because I'm trying to make friends and trying to pull girls. I'm doing it because I enjoy the process of it. So let's fucking do it. And that's the recent, I guess, resurgence of energy.\n\n\nHow much time did you take off to from stand up out on and off like a year or two?\n\n\nWhen I had a couple of seasons in Silicon Valley, I would do stand up maybe at Max, I would just go down to Comedy Magic Club once every two months just so I can, you know, talk to some friends or something.\n\n\nJust wasn't into it dusted off and.\n\n\nYeah, but it was stuck in that same old material, wasn't feeling it.\n\n\nAnd the reason for the special really was I kind of got pissed.\n\n\nI was because everybody that was coming up to me in the streets, like in Silicon Valley, whatever, and there's some YouTube clips, people watching me doing things like, oh, I didn't know this motherfucker can do stand up, you know?\n\n\nAnd I'm like, man, I am a stand up. I start as a stand up. I think I'm a better standard than I am an actor, you know.\n\n\nSo let me prove to the world I'm not just like a Vine guy or actor trying to do stand up. I am an actor who used to be a stand up and that is my fucking forte.\n\n\nThat's awesome. I had a similar thing when I was on Newsradio. I kind of stopped writing for a while, like a couple of years.\n\n\nI was just doing the same old material, just phone in and then. Yeah, yeah.\n\n\nBecause when you make a money you don't like, it's hard. You got to find a new motivation and then have some people come to see me and bomb.\n\n\nOne night at the Commodore and I woke up, I was like, I got to go back to work. I haven't slept, I'm just doing the same old shit.\n\n\nI knew the material was stale. Yeah, it was flat. Didn't have any connection to it.\n\n\nI was just saying it because I was using it like a tool, like a screwdriver, you know, wasn't there was no like people understand the feel what's going on in your head when you're talking about things and if you're not totally tuned in to what you're saying, they don't want to hear it.\n\n\nYes. Yes.\n\n\nIt's it's I think stand ups can all be great actors and we all have to be a base for that because one of the magic tricks and stand up is you told that joke a thousand times, but you got to make it sound like it's the first time.\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\nAnd if you just mailing it in and just telling it as if you're reading a script in your head, it's like watching bad acting on TV.\n\n\nIf the guy ain't feeling it, you're not going to be feeling it. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n\nI always describe it as mass hypnosis, that it's like there's a vibe that you're you're putting it out.\n\n\nYou're you're you're hitting a frequency. And the audience, if the words are well worked, if you you have a good economy of words, the things you're saying resonate. It all makes sense. You have confidence, you focus. All these things are correct. Your delivery is comfortable. It makes people feel good. They just let you think like, go, Jimmy, think for me.\n\n\nI want to hear what you have to say. And they don't they're not judging, they're just like letting you take them for a ride and it's kind of like when someone's really Killorn when you watch someone on stage killing your eyes are open, your jaws will be like you just going along with it. You're going along with whatever they're saying.\n\n\nYou know, it's, you know, Owen Smith, Owen Smith's Killorn. Like, I think the way he's thinking, like I'm allowing him to lead my mind.\n\n\nYou can't wait till you hear his next stop. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n\nYou're not, like, going out to this or he's. Well, I'm bored with what he's saying. No, no. You're letting if someone's got a well crafted act. But that's the thing is like creating that act like boy, you're gonna have some weird hiccups when you put it together, when you got new shit and it's clunky and it's awkward and yeah.\n\n\nMaybe go down a road that you don't want to go down. You're like, I got to get out of this bit. You don't know how.\n\n\nAnd one bad new joke in an hour said, like, if you just have one bad new joke 20 minutes in, you need the next ten minutes to prove your worth again.\n\n\nYeah. Because they're like, oh, this guy. I don't know. Yes. Yeah.\n\n\nAnd you got to be real careful if you want to open up with a new joke who they say never do that.\n\n\nI mean, I don't say I don't agree with that. I don't think there's any never do that. Right. Right. There's any never do. Other than you know, I mean, there's definitely a few never do that. But but if you got an idea and you know it's fire. Yeah. You know, it's going to crack you like just let me just run this on stage.\n\n\nI know I got a real bit I can do if this doesn't work. Yeah. I have a nice Segway into a real bed. Right, right, right.\n\n\nIn case this takes I'm just going to cut it in half and then go into my old bit.\n\n\nBut when some shit just happened like three hours ago and you go on stage, there's a certain energy to that to which the audience is like this one guy has no idea if this is any good.\n\n\nLike, you just you have a hot take on something that just happened a few hours ago. There's energy to that. Yes, yes. Yes.\n\n\nAnd some some things that, you know, it's an old joke that you've done, say, for two years. And you're like, man, this is what happened.\n\n\nYeah, he lost the eye, is it not? And then you try to force some energy into it. Still, it's not there.\n\n\nIt's because to you it's fresh and maybe there is an amazing actor or you can put some acting skill into that to pretend, but it's still not there.\n\n\nYou have to really be interested in what you're saying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can't fake that. No, it's comedy. It's a weird thing going on that's not defined between us and the audience. It's very weird. Yeah.\n\n\nAnd sometimes even you think you're saying it with energy and with that same rigor. You watch yourself on TV like, nah, I'm just going through the motions and reading lines, you know, ahead.\n\n\nYeah. Yeah. Same thing with acting. You don't want to do too many takes.\n\n\nOh yeah. You know when you really tell when you're high, if you go to the movies when you're high, go this guy's phoning it in. Yeah. You could see it. There's like sometimes you go to the movies and you're high and it's just like seamless. You just go on this little journey. You believe every word. Yeah. Every now and then someone will pop out like glue.\n\n\nThis motherfucker acting. Yes. Yes.\n\n\nI never forget. I went to see the Hulk with Eric Bana. Remember that guy? He was way many hawks. There's this one clunky scene.\n\n\nMaybe they did it too many times or whatever, but is acting because I was barbecued. I mean, I'm in the audience watching this. And I was like, this is so acting like I'll never forget in that moment.\n\n\nI'm like, this guy's act is fake.\n\n\nSo there's the space for show that I just did. How is that? Great. I'm on Netflix, right? It's Netflix. It's Steve Carell, John Malkovich, Greg Daniels.\n\n\nI mean, that's a great fucking fucking great dream come true.\n\n\nYeah. And it's interesting because sometimes if you're kind of unprepared, you go do a scene and you don't have your lines memorized.\n\n\nSomehow you pull it off because it's fresh. It's as if you're saying the line.\n\n\nBut sometimes when you rehearse, I'm really just one scene in this one episode.\n\n\nI don't think I don't think other people would know, like people aren't actors like but I watch it myself because I remember the day when I was doing that scene. I was like, oh, I'm killing it. I'm riffing. I'm like, you know, me and the girl I'm tiny that I'm doing the scene with, which just going back and forth, it's feels good.\n\n\nIt's like a little boxing match.\n\n\nBut then when I watched, I was like, damn, seems a little rehearsed because I think I rehearsed in my mind.\n\n\nI know she's going to say this. I'm going to say this.\n\n\nEven though it felt good, it felt like a flowed it lost a little bit of that natural saying for the first time.\n\n\nAnd that was tough for me to watch that myself. And I don't want to say which scene it is because I don't think people could tell. But I could. And it kind of kills me. That makes sense.\n\n\nLike, you know. Well, also, like, you know what you're going to say. There's no surprise when someone is watching the scene. There's all this surprise to it because like they're kind of like it's like watching a magic trick. It's like, where's his hands? I don't even know what he did. Yeah, I know you're talking and they don't have any idea where you're going and they just follow along, you know. Everything you're going to say before you say it, so you watch, yeah, the weirdness and I know what she's going to say when you know everything, I mean, a really great actor who's supposed to know everything, everything.\n\n\nAnd then you use your skills to pretend you've heard it for the first time.\n\n\nRight. Which is a stand up also.\n\n\nAnd and sometimes you forget that you just like. Yeah, feels good. But it's not it's practice. It looks like practice.\n\n\nDid your family give you a hard time about wanting to do stand up, Dad.\n\n\nThere's quite the story there. It's a feel good story. Let me preface with that. So, yeah, my dad was in finance. He hooked me up with that finance job. And when I was like, I don't know, I just don't want to do this. What do you have?\n\n\nAnother job was like, no, I'm going to give the stand up thing a try. And this was like a year or two. And obviously I wasn't making any money. So he was very disappointed. He was hoping it was just a phase. You know, he doesn't even know, as Dana was old Chinese guy, he just like a talk show like you just keeps calling a talk show still till today, a talk show just never got it.\n\n\nSo I was finishing my last year school in San Diego. I got just random jobs. I worked at a used car lot during a day. I worked at that comedy palace collecting tickets and trade for like stage time in the evening.\n\n\nAfter that, I'll go put another shift as a deejay at a strip club. Just so I was like trying different things, you know, and I didn't want to lock myself into something. And then eventually the acting started to do a little better.\n\n\nYou know, my first job was two broke girls at two lines, you know, and I was so proud. I was so proud of myself. I was finally making some money. I call my dad.\n\n\nI was like that, you know, why don't you, you know, watch CBS tonight, you know, I'm going to be on there and stuff.\n\n\nHe's like, I don't I don't have to be CBS as I hope that doesn't fucking have CBS. It's a stickups ten phone back.\n\n\nYour TV gets CBS. So he was just really knocked down. Right. And then eventually when I got on Silicon Valley, the old man understands what a contract is, a serious regular job on HBO.\n\n\nHe's acting. He got it. So he was finally happy. I was financially secure.\n\n\nSo instead of ever giving it up and say like, hey, Jimmy, good job, I'm proud of you, maybe I was wrong.\n\n\nGood for you. You know what he said? He was like, oh, it's so easy. You can do it. I can probably do it. And he started becoming an actor.\n\n\nI was like I was like, OK, Dad, you know what? If you think it's so easy, dude, I was like that. If you think it's so easy.\n\n\nI was it was a very small agency at the time. I'm like, you know, I'm going to, you know, sign you up with her, see if she needs an older Asian guy because she does not a lot of older Asian guys out there competing.\n\n\nSo she signed him. And then I was like, good, good, good. Now, are you going to go to auditions and understand how fucking hard my life is? How are the rejections? I face all the nerves I got to deal with. But then the plan completely backfired because he went to those auditions and killed it.\n\n\nHe booked like his first six out of ten jobs, which is like an unheard of ratio, you know. I mean, yeah, like you'd be lucky to book like five percent of jobs, but he was killing it like non-union gigs.\n\n\nHe even got on this show. I talk about this a little bit. My standup, he even he even got on the show. That shot in San Francisco is a Chinese show. We thought it was no big deal. Low budget Chinese show became the biggest show in China, became like the fucking modern family of China.\n\n\nAnd then my aunt from Shanghai would call the house like, Richard, you're such a good actor. You son must have taken after you. I was like, what the fuck am I?\n\n\nRight. But now I've accepted it.\n\n\nThat's who we are. Yes, I'm happy that me and my dad's in the same business in a way that's crazy.\n\n\nAnd it's a fun story to tell people. Right.\n\n\nSo I was jokingly saying that story to John Malkovich, best sports on, you know, space for us. Everybody gets a kick out of this little story. Episode nine and Space for us comes around. We're doing a table read and it's a China versus America thing in this episode. And they needed a couple older Chinese scientists that are authentic Mandarin speaking Chinese people.\n\n\nAfter the table with Greg Daniels, the showrunner, he's like, you know, just I don't know. It's always the same guys, you know, just whatever. And John Malkovich was the one that said, what about Jimmy's dad? Have you thought about Jimmy's dad? And I didn't have thick enough skin to volunteer my dad.\n\n\nAnd and then that night I went home. I cut together an acting real for my dad and I sent it to Greg. All I said was like, Greg, maybe give the old man a chance.\n\n\nHe's got a good look.\n\n\nI think he fits this older scientists in China just let me come in and audition. But I guess Greg was so impressed with the tape, he just hired him.\n\n\nWow. Episode nine of Space Force. My dad is in it. He he's great.\n\n\nHe comes in no fear and is seen as toe to toe with John Malkovich. Wow. And how long has he been acting?\n\n\nI mean. Two years, if not years, never taken, no classes, so crazy. Yeah, wow, I practiced with them on Skype, you know, for that scene, you know, because I was like that. Don't make me look bad.\n\n\nDon't fuck this up. Make sure you remember your lines. Right. And then he he was he was practicing. And he's like, can you screen grab me, record me so I can see my own performance, you know?\n\n\nAnd actors were all very self-conscious. I hate to watch myself.\n\n\nSo I recorded him. I sent him that tape and then he looked at it.\n\n\nHe was just like, wow, I'm really good. Look at me like I'm like listening to I'm good at this.\n\n\nI was like, go, go for it.\n\n\nBut it's that blind sense of confidence and also the fact that he never thought to be an actor. So there's no fear.\n\n\nYeah, I was nervous as hell. My first day with John Malkovich and Steve Carell, my dad came in with just chillin.\n\n\nThat's so funny. Yeah. It's funny that it totally backfired. Yeah. But now, now it's fine. It's a fun father and son story. That's a great story.\n\n\nIt's so funny that he saw you doing it. Like I can do that, you know, he could do it. He's a talented guy.\n\n\nYou know, he he wants to do standup now. Really. He was like, oh, he's seventy something. Seventy two, three. Wow.\n\n\nAnd he was like, well Jimmy you think I can do some standup. I was like, sure, just go sign up for an open mic at the Laugh Factory. I'll put your name in the hat.\n\n\nHow about that. It was like, oh no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not doing open mikes. Can I do some theater or something?\n\n\nI was like that. No, that's theater. Yeah. He was like, no, I'm not doing for five people. I need to do it. If I do it, I need like five hundred people.\n\n\nOh my God. I was like that. That's not how it works.\n\n\nBut who knows, maybe when he does it in front of five hundred people he fucking kills.\n\n\nWhat if your dad gets a fucking Netflix special next year? What if your dad just starts murder and puts together some whole routine?\n\n\nYou imagine how crazy that would be if your dad's just a murderer. Just up on stage, crushing punch line, bang, bang, bang.\n\n\nI want to say I would be happy for him, but there's probably a part of me that's like the guys just.\n\n\nBut how could it not be? He's always been the funny one in the family, though.\n\n\nHe's always a ball buster and everything really kind of came naturally to him.\n\n\nYeah. Wow. There he is. Yeah. I don't know if you can find that space forseen episode nine, but completely fearless. Very natural.\n\n\nHas he written stand up? Does he have any ideas of stuff he would talk about?\n\n\nYou know what, I should have him right now set to see what the materials would be.\n\n\nYeah. Hmm hmm. I don't know. I that I got offended the acting stuff because I because I always felt like I snuck into acting. I wasn't trained at Juilliard or whatever.\n\n\nRight. So that was so it's kind of a similar path.\n\n\nHe snuck into acting, I snuck into acting, whatever. But the stand up thing kind of offended me.\n\n\nYou know, I'm like, I fucking put in ten years, dude, you can't just go do a goddamn theater.\n\n\nWhat if he does he I mean, maybe he can open for me one day or my next special.\n\n\nThat would be fun. If you have him open. It would be interesting because that's a rough spot anyway, even for a regular comic going to warm everybody up for a few minutes before they start rolling.\n\n\nYeah, but if I introduce them as like my dad, that would help. And people heard the story on the show. Right. Or my stand up, then people would love it.\n\n\nBut you've seen you've seen like a minor or like a YouTube or trying to stand up the five minutes.\n\n\nA crowd is crazy because they love this person and they're laughing. But then it's hard to keep that momentum going if you don't have the goods.\n\n\nThat's what they say about famous people doing standup in particular. Like you get a couple of minutes where they're happy to see you. And then, after all, like, oh, this guy's fucking terrible.\n\n\nThat happened to me when I first transitioned from just unknown. Stand up to the guy from Silicon Valley.\n\n\nDo you still remember the first couple of minutes were, like, so hot I couldn't follow my own hype, kind of, you know, and it's interesting because my character on Silicon Alley, he's like he has an accent. He's an immigrant, you know, like we were talking about earlier.\n\n\nSo a lot of people for a while coming up to me in the streets when I didn't know I was a stand up, they didn't know I acted beyond that show.\n\n\nThey were like, oh, ying yang from that show. I was like, Yeah, yeah, sure. Thanks for watching.\n\n\nAnd then they're just like, oh, shit, I don't know. You speak English in real life.\n\n\nSo imagine the stand up crowd seeing that they have to get over that first day like, oh shit, this this motherfucker speak English. So that takes two minutes out of all. And then and then they start to accept me as a as a standup.\n\n\nDo you address that right away? I say this yes.\n\n\nIn my special sometimes. And people laugh because it's true that that's what they think when they see me or when they saw me. It was years ago, you know. Yeah, yeah.\n\n\nNo, it would be really hilarious if your dad became a killer comic. I should train them. Fuck, yeah, I should. Help them write bits we thought about doing like not a reality show, but like a little adventure show me and my dad and I take them to try to find an agent, go to auditions and like, bring them to the Comedy Store to get advice from you guys. So so you can be a comic. Maybe I should I should go ahead with that.\n\n\nI don't know.\n\n\nTony Hinche, Cliff's mom, went on stage and killed Tony when he wrote bits for and he taught her how to do it. And she fuckin murdered really murdered his mom's.\n\n\nHilarious, just natural. No state there. She's you know, she's a woman who's had a long life and she's experienced a lot of shit. And and Tony wrote stuff for her and everybody was happy to see her and she went up there and fucking killed. What do you think she did, Jamie? About four minutes. Five minutes.\n\n\nThat's a lot for the first time, dude, she fuckin killed. Really. I mean, she fucking killed. I mean, killed. Like, I was laughing, like, by I think tomorrow was with me on the stage. I think he he was I think it was dumb. He was laughing and we were all laughing hard, like she was like Tony wrote the bits which helped a lot.\n\n\nObviously he's a great writer. She was delivering them like a killer.\n\n\nI, I would not write for my dad. I want them to eat shit a couple.\n\n\nYou you have to get somebody to respect your craft, man.\n\n\nRight. Because he doesn't respect acting. Yeah. You know, not that he doesn't respect. He just thinks it's a little easy.\n\n\nHe's a genius, you know. I don't know, I don't know if it's a lack of respect for the arts or is it overconfident in his own ability.\n\n\nBut is it overconfident if he pulled it off and so much about acting? Is it is confidence? Yeah. Not being shaken for yourself. It's the correct amount of confidence. It is a correct.\n\n\nHe's so relaxed.\n\n\nI have a video I got to find on my phone and show you. So it's in the hallway between setups. Me and Malkovich is running lines and I'm nervous and Malkovich works hard.\n\n\nLike at his level. He still works hard.\n\n\nHe's amazing. We're running lights, you know, in between. Takes the camera pans, pans a bunch of empty chairs and pans to my dad and an actor fell asleep, just dead asleep.\n\n\nSo relaxed.\n\n\nShilan is about to work with John Malkovich. That's hilarious.\n\n\nNo nerves. Wow. Yeah. Does he know who John Malkovich is? He does, absolutely. Wow.\n\n\nAnd he still didn't give a fuck? No. I think maybe it comes with age. You know, when you're seventy something, you kind of you've seen so much.\n\n\nHe is such a fanboy.\n\n\nLike he loves taking selfies with people. It's rare.\n\n\nAt first it started off with just like crazy rich Asians like Patriots Day, this movie that they were Wahlberg, you know, in the premiere.\n\n\nI'll take them to the premiere, my parents, and just to kind of finally get their approval, you know, and he gets it. He gives it up. He was like very emotional.\n\n\nYou don't have to crazy rich Asians and all that.\n\n\nBut his his goal is not to celebrate with a son there.\n\n\nHis goal is to get selfies and the after party, you know, the Chinese Grauman Theatre premieres, you know, at the Chinese theater.\n\n\nThere he is right there, Mark Wahlberg. And he just keep doing selfies and and like I was sitting on a table and and maquettes this table and his boys and his security.\n\n\nAnd then my dad just leaned over to me and was like, hey, you think you think we can go get a picture of Mark?\n\n\nI was like, I don't I don't I don't want to I don't want to ask him because I have fought so hard to not ask for pictures with people I work with. I want a picture of Mark. I want a picture Malkovich. But at the same time, I want to just be a colleague.\n\n\nI don't want to be a fan, of course. But then my dad forces me to do that. He's just got school.\n\n\nI was used to that, though. He probably just exactly if I asked. I think it's still kind of lame, but if it's like, hey, Mark, my parents are big fans, can they get a picture and they just shoot old Chinese people?\n\n\nSo that was everybody kind of gets a kick out of him.\n\n\nHe played my dad. And Patriot's Day really is a very small scene. It's a that's an interesting that's how he got his SAG card. That's hilarious.\n\n\nTalk about nepotism in Hollywood. Oh, that is nepotism. That's how it works. Well, but you know what?\n\n\nI was actively trying to improve that movie because the movie was very serious.\n\n\nIt's about the Boston Marathon bombing. And I was playing a based on real life Chinese person, you know, very detailed stuff.\n\n\nLike he speaks with a Chinese accent, but it's a Sichuan Chinese accent when he mixes his Ls and Ts, I forget I forget what it was, but I studied it for a long time.\n\n\nIt's not just a generic Chinese accent. Right.\n\n\nAnd then his parents, of course, speaks the Sichuan dialect, or at least just a very proper Mandarin. And the actor they first hired to play my dad it just escape scene. Very simple. That actor they first hired to play my dad spoke Mandarin with a Cantonese accent.\n\n\nSo I went up to Pittsburgh to. Right, to ask Petmin, I, I got to say something. The whole point of this movie is honoring these heroes and be authentic. And this guy you guys might not be able to tell. I know.\n\n\nAnd the Chinese audience will know this guy's from Hong Kong or from Guangdong or something. He's not from Sichuan or mainland China, you know.\n\n\nSo I say, yeah, sure, we'll find another guy.\n\n\nAnd I was like, yeah, I'll sit in with you, have some auditions and stuff if you want. I was like, Yeah, sure. You know what? We're shooting in Boston might take a long time. I was like, Pete, why don't you just hire my dad?\n\n\nAnd that was it. They hire my dad. That's hilarious. Yeah, no, that's hilarious. But it's it's for the art. It's for the authenticity.\n\n\nDude, I'm not so secretly hoping your dad kills of the best story.\n\n\nI want to have you back on after your dad was just murdered a few times on stage. And you're like, what the fuck?\n\n\nOh, my God. If he if he comes on this podcast and he'll be a huge star, I don't know if I get a handle on that, because right now it's very much like I'm hooking him up.\n\n\nI'm still the star, you know, he's just my dad. But what if I'm starting a known as Richard son?\n\n\nLike acting that will be now we kind of rough. That's going to be hard that he's going to have to really do something special to pull that off. Well, we'll see. We'll see. Maybe he have his own hand Gadsby special.\n\n\nI mean, and just only talk shit about me in the special that we funny of, like you and Tony or whoever, a bunch of great writers and great comedians start plotting against me for his success, you know.\n\n\nRight for me. Oh my God. What strategies for how to how to kill. Oh, my God. He loves it. Man. That's great though. That's so cool.\n\n\nIt's a good father and son bonding.\n\n\nWhat did your dad used to do for a living? What was his.\n\n\nHe was always like a really successful salesman. He had his own medical device company that he sold in salesman.\n\n\nYes. That's a thing where you have to have personality and you have to know how to read a room. Yeah, like we were talking about Alcoholics Anonymous is like a good gateway into comedy.\n\n\nI think maybe salesmen might be, too.\n\n\nAnd then when he came to America, he became a financial advisor.\n\n\nSo that's people to people. You got to give presentations. So he was always a great public speaker.\n\n\nAnd I think I took after him. I never really had much stage fright so that he's a natural.\n\n\nAnd you say bust balls. So he's always joking around. He's the funny one in the family team.\n\n\nOh, my God.\n\n\nYeah, I think he's going to kill Richard. Yeah. Yeah, I hope he does. I really do. Yeah. Well, you got to hope he does.\n\n\nMaybe he would do a two man show for Netflix.\n\n\nSo the odds of him being better than you are very slim. Just be honest. But don't you just want him to do well, want to be good?\n\n\nDo I really do? I think it's really a joke about the jealousy. I really don't care. He's an old man.\n\n\nLet him live his bucket list back with John Malkovich. You know, I mean, like, I'm I'm just being good son. Trying to hook my dad up now. Oh, man.\n\n\nI can't wait to see how this plays out. When is he going to do stand up? Do you have a timeline? Was he going to try it when clubs get back open again?\n\n\nWell, I think once I told him he can't just do theaters, he kind of became disinterested.\n\n\nHe doesn't want to do open mics. But you got to or maybe dozen got to me.\n\n\nI mean, it depends on how how much of a perspective he has, if he has, like, real takes on things that he could just go on stage with.\n\n\nYeah, you never know, man.\n\n\nWell, here's the thing. If he goes on stage without the context of this is Jimmy's dad and he just an old man doing a set. I don't know. That's that's a long road.\n\n\nBut if I bring him up and he's my dad, I think people just kind of eat it up, give him a little more slack maybe.\n\n\nBut that might help you accept the fact that he kills. What if he goes on stage without any recognition of you whatsoever? He is just someone introduces him, he goes on stage and just fucking murders that behind to take.\n\n\nThat would be hard.\n\n\nYeah, because if you bring him up and you give him a little training wheels and you push him, you give a little boost, really go.\n\n\nIt's exactly what I was saying. How you can't immediately be good and stand up. You need to put in that five, ten years. But if he's just good.\n\n\nYeah, I would question myself, like I would be like, well fuck.\n\n\nI must please tell me when he's going to do it please. OK, we're going to tell me when he's going to do it and I want to go.\n\n\nI want to go. What. Don't encourage him. I don't want just people showing up. I want to please do it in town.\n\n\nPlease do it now. But if I was an older guy though I'd be really worried about covid.\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\nSo like it's going to be a while before he's probably willing to go to a comedy club or something, right. Yeah.\n\n\nAnd yeah. Yeah. Speaking of that, I mean I try to see him. Every week, so I'm like very careful. You know, I was I don't want to kill them, you know, but yeah, we'll see. Maybe he'll do one of those virtual zoom rooms.\n\n\nI don't have to do that. Let's set them up the wrong way.\n\n\nYeah, you know what? I should I should completely let go of my ego and right from what should I not do that? Should I see how good he is with that?\n\n\nYou got to see how good he is first.\n\n\nLet him do it first. Yeah. Don't want him. Just let him do it. Has he been to a live performance by you?\n\n\nYes. How many shows the scene live?\n\n\nI think only one or two. Because he's disinterested in stand up. It's not it's not his thing. He gets movies, he gets TV, he doesn't get stand up. And one time I was doing a Bright Girls Club in Vegas, MGM. I was like, all Chinese people understand Vegas. I'm going to hook them up with a nice room. I was, I think, opening on middling.\n\n\nIt is years ago I was like finally a see me MGM because they know that's a nice place going to a comedy club. I crushed it that night. I could set and you know, afterwards, you and the headliner and everyone's out there shaking hands, meeting people. My parents walked out.\n\n\nRight. My mom's all smiles. She's very just positive, you know, General.\n\n\nAnd then my dad walked out and then my my buddy Jack was next to me. He was the middle. I was the opener. Yeah. My buddy Jack Cohen, older comic, he he went up to my dad. He was like, oh, my God.\n\n\nHey, Richard, aren't you so proud of you, son? He's so good. Right? And then my dad just looked at me in front of the entire audience of everyone else shaking.\n\n\nAnd he's like, no, Jimmy's not funny.\n\n\nOh. Yeah, wow, yeah, and I don't know if he was years later, he said.\n\n\nThat was a joke because because it's not he said this, he said it's not funny if I tell you you're funny, but it's funny if I tell you it's not funny.\n\n\nThere's a story there. I was like, yeah, but yeah.\n\n\nYou're my dad, though. I mean, come on. Like, you're not you're not my buddy at an open mic. Yeah.\n\n\nAnd then he also said he was like, well, I honestly didn't think it was funny because I don't get the references. I don't get culturally like what you're saying about whatever. I didn't get it. So he's kind of just being honest also.\n\n\nSo he's trying to be funny in his own way while being honest about his own take on it.\n\n\nI don't.\n\n\nYeah, yeah. He's honest, but he's also still being the ball breaker, right?\n\n\nHe's a funny guy, but sometimes it's hard to be his son if he's using me at the expense of, you know, comedy.\n\n\nIs it like the style comedy, like insult comedy. You say ball ball breaking like what kind.\n\n\nYeah, that's what he does. Yes. Like older Chinese Don Rickles.\n\n\nYes. Yes.\n\n\nThat's what Chinese people I think in general I say this my standup and it's funny if I do it in front of a white audience or a non Chinese audience, what does that really happen?\n\n\nLike I do this bit about how Chinese people would tell you exactly what the fuck is wrong with your face, like Thanksgiving. You know, my mom would tell my girl cousin like, oh, Christina, you got so fat just straight.\n\n\nI was like, Mom, you can't say that. And then and then my mom and my dad would be like, oh, if we're not telling her who would? And like also being like a comedian. I mean, not not being I mean, being fat cause I'm going to say, oh, being Chinese, being fat or gaining weight is prosperous. It's good, it's auspicious or whatever.\n\n\nI want to do this. She's a girl. You can't fucking say that.\n\n\nYou know, Christina is not fat and she's this beautiful young woman, you know, and yeah, it's hard to grow up with a high self-esteem in an Asian household, you know, but there is a weird honesty to it.\n\n\nI don't know. I don't buy it. They say it's honest.\n\n\nI think it's me pass down trauma that their parents did that to them and now they're doing it. Yeah, I don't know.\n\n\nWell, there's something about work ethic in Asian households. When I was young, one of my good friends with this kid, his name was Zhongxue Jong Chang, and he went on to be national taekwondo champion while while he was in his medical residency. Yeah, I always used to compare myself to him if I ever thought I had discipline or worked hard. I compare myself to that guy. I was like, I'm a lazy fuck. This guy was he worked so hard, but he was telling me that this is just how it was with his family.\n\n\nNothing you ever did is good enough. Like he's Korean.\n\n\nAnd he was like, my parents are so ruthless. It's like everything had to be better. Nothing was ever good. It didn't matter if you had straight A's, you could do better. You can always do better. You never, never good enough.\n\n\nIt's interesting, I think that that is more like the very stereotypical Asian parents, the helicopter tiger parents or whatever.\n\n\nTiger Tiger mom, I think is a real term.\n\n\nMine is, I guess, a little nuanced, like they would give it up for academic and they always call me smart and stuff, but they will make fun of me.\n\n\nLike I remember after orchestra practice in high school, once my dad came very proud of me playing the violin and like, oh, you're great, you know? So that stuff, they'll give it up, you know.\n\n\nBut then a girl, this really cute white girl came and talk to me after Tracey with her name that I kind of had a crush on.\n\n\nShe just came and talked to me. She was like, oh, my God, you're so good.\n\n\nHey, hey, I'll talk to you later. Gave me a hug and everything.\n\n\nAnd I was such a nerd, I didn't get any action. And then and then I just looked at my dad. I was hoping he'll be proud, you know? And then he looked at me like you and her. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.\n\n\nSo certain things like he goes a little too far making fun of you. That's a confidence crusher from Pops. Yeah.\n\n\nBut I mean, once again, it could be because he grew up, he never got no girls like that.\n\n\nSo he's like a I like why with my son you know.\n\n\nDo you think he's competing with you a little bit there and that way? I hate to think about that, but I think there's got to be a part of that. That's got to be a part of why you wanted to get into acting. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Hmm.\n\n\nMaybe that's one of the reasons why so confident because he shits on you and if you can do it, it's a fucking I can do it. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n\nIt's a weird like he he picks and chooses what he gives it up and not.\n\n\nOh so it's manipulative a little bit so you never know. It's like a. Yeah, yeah. Stockholm syndrome, well, you know, I call them out once, and I was like that, why don't you what why don't you, first of all, tell me any dating advice?\n\n\nAnd also, why did you never think I could like Daku Girls or whatever like that took me years to overcome.\n\n\nAnd he was like, sure.\n\n\nBut like I always said, you were smart. Right. But you just give me like a nonanswer of like he's like. But I always said you were smart. That's what it's what's important to me. Hmm, yeah, so it's sort of like he's excusing the fact that he. Dismissed your ability to I think whatever he wasn't good at, he projected on me like I was as small as I was.\n\n\nI was a pretty good athlete. I could run pretty fast. I can jump pretty high. I used to play basketball even though I was like the underdog, but I was athletic, you know. But my dad, like when I was trying out for the high school basketball team and that was like, no, you can't do that.\n\n\nYou're flat footed just like me.\n\n\nYou can't come on. Oh, that's so that's the opposite of what some weird, like theater parents do or our coach parents do. The thing that happens when kids get into athletics with their parents failed at sports and then they get really invested in their kid being awesome.\n\n\nYes, yes. I'm not sure which way is healthier or both of them less healthy.\n\n\nYeah, they're both gross. Yeah.\n\n\nYeah. Yeah, there's something really weird about like it's a burden, too, for the kids, like I've seen it with kids were the overbearing parents who just want the kid to succeed so.\n\n\nWell, because it's like, that's my boy out there kicking ass. That's my boy. Look how fast you were very selfish.\n\n\nI really care about the kid being happy or not.\n\n\nAnd it also fucks with the kids head it a lot of times it ruins their love of whatever the sport is. Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah.\n\n\nI don't know. I guess. Me, you know, it's fine, it's fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. You're just fine, Dad, I'm fine. I've seen enough therapy.\n\n\nI'm I'm fine. It's fine. It's fine. He's flawed. We're all flawed. Yeah.\n\n\nYeah, no worries. It's like the scene in Good Will Hunting. Like, I'm afraid you're going to be like Robin Williams. You, me. Like it's not your fault. Yeah, it's not your fault. And I just start bawling.\n\n\nThis whole thing is like parents that do weird shit to you. There's there's some benefit to it. Like my parents were not supportive about anything I've ever done ever. And my parents split up and I was really young. So my whole life was like, I'll show you. Oh, show you. Yeah, I don't get any attention. Watch, watch what I can do. Right.\n\n\nSo that was it led me to get really good at things. That's yeah. That was why I got really good at everything because I never got any attention. So my thought was like I know how to get attention, be better than everybody else and everything. Yeah.\n\n\nWhatever I do, I just have to be just fucking fully immersed in it. So I became obsessed with getting really good at things. If I had like really supportive parents that were really there for me all the time, like. You know, but that's you that's your personality to take that kind of negative thing and turn into something awesome, a lot of kids maybe in that same situation would have been like, oh, fuck, nobody cares.\n\n\nYeah. Yeah. Well, I got really lucky that I found martial arts, like, really. And when I found it, I realized, like, oh, I am good at this. Like, I found a thing that makes me feel like I'm not a loser. Yeah.\n\n\nI just felt like we moved around a lot.\n\n\nLike we moved from like I lived in New Jersey till I was seven and then San Francisco from seven to 11 and then Florida from 11 to 13 and then Boston from and it was like, fuck man. I never had like long, steady friends. I was always the new kid. I was always small people, always fucking with me. And then when I got into martial arts, it was the first time I didn't feel like a loser. I was like once like a year or two in when I started getting really good, I was like, this is something I'm good at.\n\n\nI'm like, really good at this. I got praise from my instructor. I got praise from other students. I was winning tournaments and I was like, I am something I can file. And so I just threw myself into it. Like I was just there was my whole life and I was thinking, like, maybe I wouldn't have been that good if I was just loved exhorting my mom to love me and my stepdad didn't love me.\n\n\nIt's just they're fucking busy, man. And they just they they also grew up in a fucked up life, too, like their their parents weren't supportive either. So it's sort of like that that cycle just sort of repeats itself with kids.\n\n\nYou know, I thought that back in the day about certain things like acting. I'm like if I didn't have low self-esteem growing up about this or if my dad never thought I could be in the arts, maybe I'll never made it here like I made it here for a reason right now.\n\n\nAnd my therapist set this one thing not to get like to like fufu or whatever. Here, set this one thing that really resonated with me.\n\n\nHe was like, have you ever thought about you made it not because of it, but despite of it. Mm. So that was, that was kind of nice to hear.\n\n\nYeah. Yeah. There's both those things right.\n\n\nIt's like whatever it is that shapes your personality, those negatives, like there's an ebb and flow to all things and sometimes those negatives gives you this gust of energy to go in the opposite direction. And the motivation that you have is sometimes more important than anything else.\n\n\nSometimes the motivator, like the willingness to go through a lot of shitty things to make it like sometimes that doesn't exactly have a good friend.\n\n\nHe's a really nice guy, but his mom was too nice to him when he was young. Like she gave him too much love and she always said he was amazing and everything. And he just like he like he even admits it.\n\n\nTalking about it is like I think my mom was just too fucking nice to me.\n\n\nLike it's had no drive. It's like he's always loved, he's always cared for and always he never felt scared.\n\n\nHe never felt alone. He never felt like there's nobody out here helping me. I've got to go do this on my own.\n\n\nAnd I remember that was like my overwhelming feeling. My whole life was like, no one's looking out for me. I got to look out for myself. This this is the world's dangerous, you know.\n\n\nMm mm. Yeah. But it's like. It's all in like I mean, that's a stupid old expression, life gives you lemons, you make lemonade, it's like whatever it is that was negative about it, it can become a positive. It can become like a reinforcing thing. Yeah, yeah. Every bad set is actually the most helpful thing.\n\n\nYes. Yeah. Dude, every time I bombed, like I talked about that one time when friends came to see me at the Comedy Store and I realized, OK, I'm phoning it in, I'm fucking up, that I needed that to happen. Yeah, I needed it to happen.\n\n\nYeah. Even even with acting or standup, it's like sometimes I'm like, OK, I'm trying really hard for this film because I'm proving myself and sometimes you.\n\n\nKose do you like. Oh wait, I coasted on that movie and people still was like oh he was good. I like whatever I was. You keep coasting, coasting and at some point you get caught.\n\n\nYeah. Oh fuck. I got to step it up again. Yeah. I mean we need lessons. No one's perfect, right. We need lessons. Lessons come and strange forms. Sometimes you don't ask for them, sometimes you get dealt a hand that you didn't want to get dealt. But it turns out to be the best thing that could ever happen to you.\n\n\nMm hmm. Absolutely. Jimmy, you're a bad motherfucker.\n\n\nGreat. Great to have you here.

    "content": "SAM SANDERS, HOST:\n\nFrom NPR, I'm Sam Sanders. IT'S BEEN A MINUTE. Today on the show - Jimmy O. Yang, the actor and comedian. Lot of you might know him for his work on HBO's \"Silicon Valley.\" Jimmy plays Jian-Yang on the show, this misfit immigrant programmer. Besides his work on \"Silicon Valley,\" Jimmy is out with a new book. It's called \"How To American: An Immigrant's Guide To Disappointing Your Parents.\" The book's all about how Jimmy grew up in America as an immigrant after moving to LA from Hong Kong when he was 13.\n\nWe talk about how Jimmy tried to make it in stand-up comedy, how he worked really, really hard to kind of not choose the path that his immigrant parents wanted for him. And we talk a lot about representation and what it means to be an Asian man on screen today. Fun fact - Jimmy is starring in a new movie. Fun fact - Jimmy's in a new movie coming out later this year. It's called \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" and it's already being called Asian-Americans' very own \"Black Panther.\"\n\nSo in this discussion of representation, Jimmy also talks about what it means to play roles with an accent, like he does on \"Silicon Valley.\" Here he is playing his character, Jian-Yang.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SILICON VALLEY\")\n\nJIMMY O YANG: (As Jian-Yang) I eat the fish.\n\nT J MILLER: (As Erlich Bachman) I understand you eat the fish. But when you clean the fish, you can't just leave the fish head and guts and [expletive] in the sink because the whole house smells like a bait station. So you got to put it in the trash and then take the trash out. Do you understand?\n\nYANG: (As Jian-Yang) Yes, I eat the fish.\n\nSANDERS: So that was a clip of Jimmy with one of his former \"Silicon Valley\" co-stars, T.J. Miller. T.J. Miller himself - he has been in the news a bit lately for some very erratic behavior and some allegations of sexual assault. But we're going to leave that alone and just focus on Jimmy for this conversation. All right, before we get into this chat, a quick warning - if you're listening to this with kids, Jimmy's amazingly fun and captivating personal story does have a bit to do with the world of adult entertainment. So there's that. All right, here's me talking with Jimmy O. Yang in our Culver City studio.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")\n\nSANDERS: I finished your book last night.\n\nYANG: Thank you so much.\n\nSANDERS: You're funny.\n\nYANG: Thanks.\n\nSANDERS: You're funny. So I was going to, in preparation for this interview, do something, and then I was like, no, it's too weird. I was going to go to El Pollo Loco...\n\nYANG: Oh, man.\n\nSANDERS: ...And get a bunch of the salsas...\n\nYANG: Dude.\n\nSANDERS: ...And have you tell me which one's your favorite.\n\nYANG: You know, I can tell you each one of the salsas without looking at it.\n\nSANDERS: OK, go.\n\nYANG: It's the green guacamole one.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: That one's by far my favorite.\n\nSANDERS: Why?\n\nYANG: Because it's watery. It's a little - it's...\n\nSANDERS: I don't believe in watery guacamole, bruh (ph).\n\nYANG: But - exactly. But it's a salsa, so it's OK. They don't try to sell you as guacamole. It's all about how you look at it. It's OK.\n\nSANDERS: That's a good rule for life, huh?\n\nYANG: You know?\n\nSANDERS: So I bring this up because there's this wonderful story about your grandfather introducing you to America through the wonders and joys of El Pollo Loco. Can you tell that story? Because it's so good.\n\nYANG: The first day me and my father and my whole family came to America - my grandpa has been living here for a few years already.\n\nSANDERS: In LA.\n\nYANG: Yeah, in LA. So he kind of knows his way around. He's like, I'm going to take you guys to my favorite American restaurant.\n\nSANDERS: And you came here at 13 from Hong Kong.\n\nYANG: Exactly.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: So grandpa walked us down La Cienega Boulevard, and it was like...\n\nSANDERS: Which is a street you don't walk down.\n\nYANG: You don't.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: But in Hong Kong, or even in Shanghai, where my grandpa's from, you walk down everything, right?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah, yeah.\n\nYANG: So he has kind of no concept of how far to walk. And we end up walking down 45 minutes of just nothing but strip malls and six-lane traffic down La Cienega.\n\nSANDERS: Where on La Cienega were you?\n\nYANG: It was La Cienega by, like, Olympic.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, ugh. OK.\n\nYANG: ...That massive intersection.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah, why would you do that?\n\nYANG: Took 45 minutes to walk, like - I don't know - like, 2 miles to another massive strip mall with, like, a LA Fitness and everything. And I don't even know what that is. I have no concept of gyms.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...Because I came from Hong Kong. Everybody was skinny.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: And we walked our calories off. We didn't have to go to the gym.\n\nSANDERS: Or we're outside at the park at 6 in the morning doing your stretches. Is that happening over there?\n\nYANG: That happens everywhere.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: What are they doing? Anywhere you go, there's 250 old Asian people at 6 a.m. stretching.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: It's crazy.\n\nSANDERS: I don't know how much of this makes the cut, but I love it. So keep going. You're walking down La Cienega...\n\nYANG: Walking down La Cienega - after 45 minutes in this massive strip mall, my grandpa, like - this is my favorite restaurant in America. It's authentic Mexican food, and you cannot find this in China. And I looked up, and it said, El Pollo Loco.\n\nSANDERS: And we should point out, it is a downscale, fast food, Mexican drive-through chain.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: So you go in there. What is it like for you?\n\nYANG: The cash register person was asking my grandpa, do you want dark meat or white meat? And then my grandpa had to explain to us, you always order the dark meat. That's the good part of chicken - the wings, the thighs...\n\nSANDERS: (Snapping) Agree. Agree.\n\nYANG: ...The legs.\n\nSANDERS: I can't with the dry breast.\n\nYANG: Yeah. And he said, the white meat is rough. That's for, like, you know, dumb American people. I'm like, OK.\n\nSANDERS: So you didn't have the chance to choose what part of the chicken you got back home.\n\nYANG: I didn't have to choose. And really, even in Hong Kong, we ordered, like, the Hainanese chicken and all that. And my dad always either got the back or, like, the leg. Nobody ever gets the breast, OK?\n\nSANDERS: Really?\n\nYANG: So I already kind of know...\n\nSANDERS: You knew what's up.\n\nYANG: ...That the breast ain't the business.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: And then there's just all these little customs that I wasn't used to. Like, in Hong Kong, you order whatever soda you want. They get it for you behind the register. Here, you get a soda, you get a water, and you go refill it yourself. And my grandpa whispered to us - he was like, hey, just get the water, OK? Because here you can just get the water and then go get soda yourself.\n\nSANDERS: Wait, wait, whoa - you...\n\nYANG: But never buy the soda because that's how they make their money.\n\nSANDERS: ...You can't do that.\n\nYANG: Well, grandpa did it. I didn't know you can just turn water into Dr. Pepper in this country. And then you walk over to the salsa bar. My grandpa was like, yo, just take - take anything you want. And I'm like, what do you mean? Like, we don't have to pay for this? He's like no - no, just take anything you want.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: And I'm like, yo, this country is amazing. So that was, like, my first experience, not just with food in America but with American freedom.\n\nSANDERS: American freedom, courtesy of El Pollo Loco.\n\nYANG: Absolutely.\n\nSANDERS: So - I love that. OK. So you have been here now since you were 13. How old are you now?\n\nYANG: Thirty.\n\nSANDERS: Thirty.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: Do you still have that same sense of what read to me in the book as this inherent amazement with all that America is? Has some of that worn off for you?\n\nYANG: Some of it, of course. With age, it kind of goes away, like the sense of innocence, seeing everything with a new lens. But now I try to go to other countries with that lens, even going back to Hong Kong. I went back to Hong Kong for the first time in 17 years and I was culture shocked in Hong Kong.\n\nSANDERS: You're home.\n\nYANG: Like, I was culture shocked - yeah. It's the opposite of what I felt when I came here when I was 13. The streets - I'm not used to the streets being this narrow now. I'm not used to people rubbing my - shoulder to shoulder. I'm not used to walking after a meal to take the subway, you know? And - everything - just the language. And - but it felt good.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah?\n\nYANG: It was a good culture shock...\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: ...Because after just a couple days of that initial shock, I found myself being very comfortable and at ease. Like, the weight of being a minority, just being something different in this country, was gone. I was just a dude.\n\nSANDERS: You're just a dude.\n\nYANG: I didn't have to be, like, the Asian dude or...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...Like, be careful of, oh, let's try to not drive a Honda Accord and go to dim sum and play pingpong because that's stereotypical here.\n\nSANDERS: Listen, I would live that life.\n\nYANG: Yeah, but...\n\nSANDERS: That'd be a wonderful day for me.\n\nYANG: Yeah, and - and that life in Hong Kong, you're just a normal dude.\n\nSANDERS: You just do it.\n\nYANG: It's not a stereotype until you come here, you know?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So I just felt at ease, man.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: I could have done whatever I wanted, whatever I liked. And I was just a dude.\n\nSANDERS: You know, hearing you talk about that, it makes me think of this movie you're going to be in soon, \"Crazy Rich Asians...\"\n\nYANG: Yes.\n\nSANDERS: ...Where it seems like you get to just be a dude because the entire cast is Asian.\n\nYANG: Absolutely.\n\nSANDERS: And the buzz around it is phenomenal already. Describe this film for folks that haven't heard about it yet.\n\nYANG: So \"Crazy Rich Asians\" is based on a book by Kevin Kwan called \"Crazy Rich Asians.\" There's three books. So if this movie does well, maybe there will be a trilogy.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: But most importantly, it's the first movie in 25 years - first studio picture in 25 years - since \"Joy Luck Club\" that features a full Asian cast.\n\nSANDERS: It's like y'all's \"Black Panther...\"\n\nYANG: Yeah, see...\n\nSANDERS: ...But not.\n\nYANG: ...I said that on Twitter. People got mad at me.\n\nSANDERS: Wait, they got - who...\n\nYANG: I'm like this is going to be our \"Black Panther\" - obviously, jokingly...\n\nSANDERS: ...Yes.\n\nYANG: ...Because the two movies are nothing alike (unintelligible).\n\nSANDERS: Well, yeah.\n\nYANG: But for me it's like - I hope - basically, with that statement, I'm saying I hope it's going to be a box office success...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...And the cultural representation that \"Black Panther\" is.\n\nSANDERS: Yes.\n\nYANG: And then black people were tweeting me. They were mad. They tell me shut the F up. And they're telling me, like, why is it, like, whenever black people got a little bit of shine, y'all got to try to take it for yourself? I'm like, what - what are you talking about?\n\nSANDERS: Twitter is bad.\n\nYANG: Yeah. And then Asian people are like, yo, this movie, it could stand on its own. Like, we don't have to compare it, like - and diminished both of the movies. And I'm like, oh, my God.\n\nSANDERS: What does it feel to make a movie like this, that is, in many ways, groundbreaking but is also entering this cultural moment right now...\n\nYANG: Yes.\n\nSANDERS: ...Where it seems everyone is always mad about everything before it's even there? You're already experiencing that with this movie because some people are saying, oh, the portrayal of Asians is too anglicized or too hetero-normative...\n\nYANG: Yup.\n\nSANDERS: ...Or they're all too pretty or whatever - like...\n\nYANG: And you know who's critiquing the hardest, or the critique that I get for my acting career? Asian people. You playing an immigrant on \"Silicon Valley\" - that makes me look bad, blah, blah, blah - all this, like, you play this accented character. But I try to play everything very authentically, even if it is an accented immigrant, Jian Yang, that I play on \"Silicon Valley...\"\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...I try to play it - it's just a version of myself when I came to this country when I was 13, and I'm trying to represent my immigrants, you know? So...\n\nSANDERS: Well, you wrote in the book something - you basically said, like, the issue is not the role. The issue is the baggage people feel about these accents themselves.\n\nYANG: Their perception.\n\nSANDERS: Like, why do you feel so bad about the accent?\n\nYANG: And Sofia Vergara is sexy with her accent. Why am I nerdy and weird?\n\nSANDERS: Everyone likes British accents.\n\nYANG: Yeah. Why is it when a white actor or even a black actor does a British accent, it's considered art? It's considered, oh, he did well. Nobody ever gave Chadwick Boseman anything, like, oh, you're doing an African accent. You're misrepresenting African people. But you know what - you know what it is?\n\nSANDERS: What is it?\n\nYANG: And this movie is hopefully going to fix part of that. It's - there's not enough of us out there.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: So everything is being scrutinized. When you're 1 out of 5 Asian people on TV, all the pressure is on you and you have to represent...\n\nSANDERS: Who are the other four?\n\nYANG: ...The whole Asian spectrum.\n\nSANDERS: Who are the other four?\n\nYANG: I can't name - I don't know.\n\nSANDERS: Wait, no - OK. Let's go through...\n\nYANG: Well, there's a few. John Cho is always on TV.\n\nSANDERS: He is always working, yeah.\n\nYANG: Yeah. My boy Ken Jeong is always in movies, TV.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah, he's something.\n\nYANG: He's hilarious - like, comic - as a comedian...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...I always think funny first.\n\nSANDERS: He's funny.\n\nYANG: Like, you know it's...\n\nSANDERS: Who else is - wait.\n\nYANG: OK.\n\nSANDERS: The list, though - who else? Who else?\n\nYANG: Constance Wu.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, yeah.\n\nYANG: Randall Park. I mean, that whole show, you know, has such - a lot of kids.\n\nSANDERS: True - \"Fresh Off the Boat\" - yeah, yeah.\n\nYANG: So there are getting more and more now.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: But it's still - it's like \"The Problem With Apu,\" that documentary, you know?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: It's - it's just 'cause...\n\nSANDERS: This is about \"The Simpsons\" character.\n\nYANG: He was the most important...\n\nSANDERS: If you're the one, you carry all the weight.\n\nYANG: Exactly. So the problem - it's - it's not enough representation. And hopefully with \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" you get a whole spectrum of Asian. And I felt so good doing that movie 'cause I could - I can just be funny and act a fool...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...Because I'm not representing all Asians. I'm just representing one personality.\n\nSANDERS: But you know some people want you to represent all Asians.\n\nYANG: Well, they want to blame me for something, you know...\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: ...Just 'cause...\n\nSANDERS: Do you ever tweet back? Do you ever write right back, or you just...\n\nYANG: I made the mistake of engaging...\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: ...About a week ago.\n\nSANDERS: What did you do?\n\nYANG: And it was horrible. It was, like, one of the worst experiences...\n\nSANDERS: What happened?\n\nYANG: ...I ever had on Twitter. Just everybody jumped on my case. You know, like, saying this and that - calling me a sellout, calling me - whatever - Uncle Chan or something.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, Lord.\n\nYANG: But like, you know, usually whatever I read, it's very positive.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: I had this girl come up to me after this book signing. It's like, we're very proud of you. You know, your success feel like our success.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: And I felt great about that. And then I have...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...People, like, you know, tweeting me great things or Instagram message. This kid - he's like, I'm 15. I just came from China. I don't speak English very well, and, like, your book is the first book I've read in English without anybody's help.\n\nSANDERS: Really?\n\nYANG: And that's really inspiring, and I hope you keep doing that. So by and large, it's great. And I love all my Asian fans, and they're awesome. But it's this small population of people...\n\nSANDERS: The haters.\n\nYANG: ...That - it's like conspiracy theorists almost...\n\nSANDERS: Really?\n\nYANG: ...'Cause then, like - you know, when they tweet you something nasty, you go on their profile to see who they are, right?\n\nSANDERS: It's never their real picture.\n\nYANG: Never...\n\nSANDERS: It's always some rando (ph) image.\n\nYANG: ...Never their real picture. Yeah, they - one guy tweeted me. They say - 'cause in a Huffington Post article, I'm like, I'm sorry I'm not the good-looking, Chow Yun-fat Asian, you know, but character actors need roles, too. You know what I mean?\n\nSANDERS: But also don't sell yourself short. Don't say that you're not good looking.\n\nYANG: Right. Right. But I'm not good-looking in the movie sense. Like, I'm sorry. I'm not, like, 6'2 and super good-looking. You're going to tell me I can't act, right?\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: Like, I shouldn't be representing you because I ain't this, this, this, right? So then I had people tweeting me. They're like, Hollywood chose you because they know you ain't good-looking. And they want to represent Asian people with your ugly face or whatever...\n\nSANDERS: Oh, my God (laughter).\n\nYANG: ...Because - and then at the end, they're like, because everybody casting you is white, dah-dah-dah (ph).\n\nSANDERS: How do they know who's casting you?\n\nYANG: I know. And then they said...\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: At the end of that tweet, they said F white supremacy. And I'm like, I'm not saying that don't exist out there, but how is that - how does that...\n\nSANDERS: You getting your check. What is supremacist about you getting your check?\n\nYANG: They're talking about white supremacist conspiracy putting me on TV...\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: ...To misrepresent Asian people on purpose. I'm like, what the hell are you talking about?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: No Ku Klux Klan member anointed me...\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: ...To be the ugly Asian person on TV. OK. You can go do it yourself. God, this makes me so angry. It's like...\n\nSANDERS: I didn't mean to make you so angry. I feel like I riled you up.\n\nYANG: Yeah, I know. It's just...\n\nSANDERS: I hear you. I hear you, though.\n\nYANG: Come on, man.\n\nSANDERS: Let's talk about the book.\n\nYANG: Yes.\n\nSANDERS: The book has the most wonderful title - \"How To American: An Immigrant's Guide To Disappointing Your Parents.\" In 30 seconds, tell folks what this book is going to give them.\n\nYANG: It's going to give you hope.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: No, it's - I hope to give people a little inspiration of this outsider - you know, making it in America, assimilating first day as an immigrant and assimilating, you know, in a job that his parents doesn't believe in.\n\nSANDERS: At all.\n\nYANG: At all. I think it - my dad has been telling me since day one - I was born - being an artist is how you become homeless.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: Pursuing your dreams is...\n\nSANDERS: Oh, yeah.\n\nYANG: ...How you become homeless.\n\nSANDERS: I love even - like, even after you've succeeded, he says - this is, like, the last page of your book - he says, quote, \"having you as my son is like winning the lottery - not the Mega Millions jackpot but like a small $20 price.\" Your dad sounds hilarious.\n\nYANG: That statement sums up exactly who he is, right?\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: Like, he busts my chops all the time.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: He's the joker of the family, but it's funny.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: It's fine. So, like, I...\n\nSANDERS: And I feel like he loves you, from what I read in the book.\n\nYANG: Absolutely. It's a complicated relationship. We love each other. But sometimes I wish he's more like that dad or that mom that's just like, I'm so proud of you. I love you, but that's not...\n\nSANDERS: That ain't him.\n\nYANG: Culturally...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...That's not it, and that's not him.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: But deep down, I know he loves me.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: And so the book deals a lot with your relationship with him and with your mother, but it's focused, really, on what it's like for you to come to America at 13. So you - one, you come from Hong Kong, which is China but not quite. And you're already kind of an outsider there because you speak a different dialect from other folks.\n\nYANG: Right.\n\nSANDERS: So you come to the U.S. at 13 - to LA, which is totally different. And you were already marginalized back home, and now you're, like, extra, extra standing out. Like, describe those first few - like, describe that first day at school.\n\nYANG: It was tough, looking back at it.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: But going through it, it was like - wow, this is kind of amazing but scary at the same time.\n\nSANDERS: Well, 'cause there was even points, like, you didn't even know what to say when someone said what's up.\n\nYANG: Yeah. I just looked up in the sky...\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: ...For like five seconds. I'm like, what are you talking about? And the girl was like, what's up? And I looked up. I'm like, nothing. There's nothing up there, and then she had to explain to me what's up meant how are you doing. And I was this foreign kid that just got dumped into a new country with a new language...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...With a new culture. I never met no black people, white people, Latino people.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: I've only hung out with Chinese people back home.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: Even the Asian people here weren't Chinese. They were Koreans. So I, like - I had nowhere to go where I can find, like, a safety zone. I was forced to assimilate with everyone...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...Which, in a way, is a blessing in disguise because...\n\nSANDERS: Makes you work.\n\nYANG: If I would've went to like a Chinese-heavy high school here in America, I could've just kind of hermitted (ph) in that sense and never really fully assimilated. You know what I mean?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. Well, I love how you describe how you figured out the culture and the language. There was one big kind of TV textbook for you, which was BET, Black Entertainment Television.\n\nYANG: Oh, yeah.\n\nSANDERS: That's kind of like how you taught yourself English and American culture. Actually, we have some tape of the time where you, I guess, shut down Arsenio Hall's show.\n\nYANG: Oh, I did.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nYANG: When I first came here - this is a true story. When I first came here, I barely spoke a word of English. And I learned how to speak English by watching a lot of television. Two months into it, I realized I was watching Telemundo.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYANG: I didn't really know. Like, what is (speaking Spanish)? And there's, like, 12 of them? What is that? So eventually I switched the channel. And you can still hear it in my voice today. I learned most of my English by watching BET \"Rap City.\"\n\n(CHEERING)\n\nYANG: Yeah. Big Tig and \"Tha Basement,\" \"Freestyle Friday.\" There's nothing more American than Snoop Dogg, you know? And I didn't know any better. I just thought that's how everybody talked. So I went up to the lunch lady the next day. I'm like, ay, what it do, shorty? Yeah.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSANDERS: Talk about all of that because I find it so fascinating.\n\nYANG: I think watching TV is one of the most important cultural lessons anyone can learn because it's not - the TV programming tells you what Americans like. And also the commercials tells you what they're really buying into, right? Like even the tone of the commercials is different. Here it's funnier whereas in Hong Kong, it's made more heartfelt, more family oriented - right? - instead of usually the dumb, bumbling husband and the wife yelling at him.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: Like here in America.\n\nSANDERS: Or like, I'm a man, and I don't know how to change a diaper - whoa.\n\nYANG: Yeah, exactly.\n\nSANDERS: I hate those.\n\nYANG: Yeah. So that really tells you about culture. And one of the most interesting channels I found when I was flipping through channels was BET. I'd never seen anything like that. It was, like, not just America. It's a very...\n\nSANDERS: No. I've never seen anything like BET either. It is one of a kind.\n\nYANG: It's a very specific part of America. And it was so intriguing to me as a 13-year-old boy. First of all, you've got \"Rap City.\"\n\nSANDERS: Oh, yeah.\n\nYANG: Right? With Big Tig and \"Tha Basement.\"\n\nSANDERS: Oh, yeah.\n\nYANG: And that was amazing. I'd never heard hip-hop music.\n\nSANDERS: See, I was on BET before that, even, when they were still doing \"Video Soul.\"\n\nYANG: Oh, my God.\n\nSANDERS: You remember \"Video Soul?\"\n\nYANG: No, that was a little before my time.\n\nSANDERS: You probably were too young for that. This was, like, when they were doing, like, straight-up, just straight ahead R&B. And then they moved more into rap with \"Rap City\" and Tigger.\n\nYANG: \"106 & Park.\"\n\nSANDERS: \"106 & Park\" was the jam. Anyways, you watched BET. You're watching rap videos.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: Rap teaches you English, basically.\n\nYANG: Rap teaches me English because to me - I could not understand a word of that. Like in school in conversation or even when I'm watching a Nickelodeon cartoon, I can understand some of it. But the way rappers are speaking, I'm like, if I can understand this - this is like calculus to me.\n\nSANDERS: Oh.\n\nYANG: If I could figure this out, I can understand algebra. I can understand...\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: ...Everything else. So...\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: ...To me, like, BET was like calculus. I needed to figure it out, and I needed to understand what they were talking about culturally to understand America - and not just \"Rap City.\" \"Comic View\" was another show.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, this is - so for those who don't know, it was BET's probably - their version of \"Def Comedy Jam.\"\n\nYANG: Absolutely.\n\nSANDERS: Stand-up comics are...\n\nYANG: Just five-minute...\n\nSANDERS: Who was your favorite one?\n\nYANG: Oh, I love all of hosts - J. Anthony Brown, Bruce Bruce...\n\nSANDERS: Bruce Bruce was amazing.\n\nYANG: ...Rickey Smiley.\n\nSANDERS: See I was all - Rickey Smiley. Oh, my God. He's the best.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: His radio stuff is amazing, too. His radio show.\n\nYANG: Yeah, now he's killing it.\n\nSANDERS: I used to love Sommore.\n\nYANG: Yes.\n\nSANDERS: She was so good.\n\nYANG: Yes.\n\nSANDERS: So between black comedy and black rap and hip-hop, you acculturate yourself to America.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: Were people at your schools loving you giving off that black swag?\n\nYANG: I think they just thought I was weird.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: You know, but it's better to be, like, the weird kid than the foreign kid to some - like, to be, like...\n\nSANDERS: Explain.\n\nYANG: ...The weird hip-hop kid...\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: ...Than the weird foreign kid because I went so hard in that hip-hop direction to try to cover up that - the fact that I'm an immigrant, and I have kind of like a Chinese accent. I covered it up with a hip-hop accent in a way. So now they just looked at me like, oh, OK. Yeah. Good for him. He just loves, you know, BET...\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: ...Instead of like, he's a weird foreign kid.\n\nSANDERS: All right. Time for a quick break. When we come back, Jimmy struggles through college and finds stand-up comedy. BRB.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nSANDERS: So you love rap so much. You love hip-hop so much. You love BET so much. You end up talking about in the book how you and the friends you made in high school - Beverly Hills High School...\n\nYANG: Yeah. My dad used a fake address.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter) You got to do what you got to do. You got to hustle.\n\nYANG: He's the man. Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: But at Beverly Hills High School, you and some other immigrant friends form a rap group. And then you become like a hip-hop rap producer - like you make beats.\n\nYANG: Yeah. That was...\n\nSANDERS: You're a producer.\n\nYANG: ...My first, I guess, creative outlet. I've always loved, like, just building stuff, like, making stuff. And this was the first thing that I found really, really rewarding was making something out of nothing.\n\nSANDERS: Had you had musical experience?\n\nYANG: I played the violin, of course...\n\nSANDERS: You say, of course.\n\nYANG: ...Since I was, like, 5. You know, I was in the school orchestra and everything.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: So I kind of know some music. But really when it comes to making a beat, especially when I was doing it, when I had FruityLoops...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah, I remember FruityLoops.\n\nYANG: ...Like, you know, those beat-making programs...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nYANG: ...It was just messing on a computer.\n\nSANDERS: How do I find your beats online? Are they online?\n\nYANG: They used to be. I don't think they are anymore.\n\nSANDERS: They're all the way gone. What would I search for?\n\nYANG: I'll post something. You can't - you really can't search for anything. I'll post some on my website.\n\nSANDERS: You should send us something, and then we can wrap the interview with, like, one of your beats.\n\nYANG: Yes, yes.\n\nSANDERS: Seriously.\n\nYANG: I have some pretty cool beats. I got pretty good at it. I was selling beats at some point.\n\nSANDERS: You know, everyone says that.\n\nYANG: No...\n\nSANDERS: My beats are great.\n\nYANG: ...I got to a point where I got my first paycheck.\n\nSANDERS: From what?\n\nYANG: You read it in the book.\n\nSANDERS: I sure did, but I want you to say it.\n\nYANG: It was a - from a porno website...\n\nSANDERS: A porno website...\n\nYANG: ...As background music.\n\nSANDERS: ...Bought one of your rap beats when you were a high school student at Beverly Hills High.\n\nYANG: Oh, boy.\n\nSANDERS: Only in America.\n\nYANG: I thought I made it. I made, like...\n\nSANDERS: How much did they pay?\n\nYANG: ...Three hundred bucks, man. You know, that was big.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter) So that's high school. High school finishes, and then your dad is like, bro, you've got to go to college.\n\nYANG: Oh, that's - I don't have a choice.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: There's never a conversation of, like, you need to go to college. It's just, oh, what's after high school? Yeah, college.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: That's it.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: Like, which college are you going to go to? That's the conversation. So I was - I didn't know any better. I didn't get into UCLA or USC.\n\nSANDERS: Their loss.\n\nYANG: Yeah, their loss. And then I end up just - got a - I got accepted to UCSD. I'm like, that's basically UCLA, but in the beautiful beach town of San Diego.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter) Except actually totally different.\n\nYANG: Yeah. I didn't even go visit. I'm like, this is close enough. I'll just go there.\n\nSANDERS: Wow.\n\nYANG: And it turned out to be the worst college experience for the five - next five years.\n\nSANDERS: What about our listeners that are - that are alumni of UCSD and loved their time there?\n\nYANG: I just - look, maybe it's not UCSD. I shouldn't be that biased. I just hated school.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: I should have dropped out. If I wasn't Asian, I would've dropped out.\n\nSANDERS: But then you end up majoring in what? Econ?\n\nYANG: Econ because...\n\nSANDERS: Because...\n\nYANG: ...That's the easiest major that still pleases your Asian parents. So I'm like, OK, I'll just get this econ degree done and I'll say I've done it and I'll figure my life out.\n\nSANDERS: And you like just did it. What was it, like, a 2.7 GPA?\n\nYANG: 2.7 GPA - I never went to class. I was depressed.\n\nSANDERS: And still got a 2.7.\n\nYANG: I was smoking weed. And I would just show up at the final - I would cram like a week before. I never learned anything because you just cram, you forget about it.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And I'd cram and then I'd go take the test. I'd get a C and then I'd pass the class.\n\nSANDERS: Even through that, though, your dad gets you an internship doing what? Like, some financial advising stuff.\n\nYANG: Yeah, Smith Barney - like, a really nice...\n\nSANDERS: That was for real.\n\nYANG: ...High-end - yeah - firm. It's like every Asian parent's dream. Like, people - other kids are, like, hoping they would get this internship. But a month in, I just hated the Smith Barney job. Like, I just - I was, like - I was having panic attacks. I'm like I'm going to be sitting behind this desk for the next 40 years...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...Managing other people's mutual fund that I don't care about. I can't do this.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: Like, that was a panic attack. That was scarier to me than trying to pursue the arts going into the unknown.\n\nSANDERS: Really?\n\nYANG: Because getting stuck - seeing my life rotting away for sure is scarier than the unknown. So for me, it wasn't ever a choice.\n\nSANDERS: So then how'd you go from there to comedy to acting?\n\nYANG: I just had to try different things to get out of this job.\n\nSANDERS: What - so what was the first thing you did after the job?\n\nYANG: It wasn't comedy. Comedy was never like - I mean, I watched comedy and I loved it but it wasn't like, oh, I watched \"Eddie Murphy Raw\" with my brother when I was a kid, I needed to be a stand-up. It was never that. It was just - I needed to find something to do with my life. I needed to find new, creative friends.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And I was pretty good at talking to people. I was kind of always the funny kid in the group, but everybody says that, right?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: You know, how many people actually make it as a stand-up?\n\nSANDERS: Everybody says that they're funny and everybody says that their beats are good.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYANG: Look, the main...\n\nSANDERS: I got to hear a beat.\n\nYANG: I - I'll - I'll send you some. The main - the main prerequisite to being a stand-up is not talent. It's not being funny. It's desperation. You needed to be that desperate to go on the stage to embarrass yourself, right?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: I always say Googling local open mics on your computer is one step away from Googling what's the best way to kill myself.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: It's that close. Every stand-up I've ever met, the guy on the stand will come - something happened in their life. They quit being a lawyer and they got a divorce or they got their third DUI, they just got out of jail, and now they want to try stand-up.\n\nSANDERS: So you join those ranks.\n\nYANG: Yeah, I join those ranks.\n\nSANDERS: You start doing open mics. And - and for a while you are actually paying money to be on stage yourself.\n\nYANG: At the Ha Ha Comedy Club, you get to go on stage anytime you want at the open mic every day, which is great, but you have to pay $5 to - in exchange for $5 of stage time.\n\nSANDERS: Five minutes of stage time.\n\nYANG: Oh, yeah, yeah - $5 of stage time. That should be my next book, \"Five Dollars of Stage Time.\"\n\nSANDERS: \"Five Dollars of Stage Time.\" So how was that?\n\nYANG: I went to this open mic and I just did it and it was fun. It was liberating in a way. But my favorite part was - literally, my first set was talking about masturbation, just like every other new comic - right? - because you don't know what - you're just - you're just trying to survive. You're just trying to be funny.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nYANG: But then people would give me taglines. Other comics would give me, like - yo, you should say this, you should say that. And I really found this, like, group of misfits. Everybody was so weird in their own way. And this is like the only world where the weirder you are, the better off you are.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So it's, like, the first time I felt like I really fit in.\n\nSANDERS: Well - and this is the interesting thing that I loved that you talked about at length in the book. You really draw this distinct comparison between acting and stand-up.\n\nYANG: Oh, yeah.\n\nSANDERS: Stand-up was very egalitarian and diverse and for everybody, as long as you're funny. And acting, you said, quote, is, like, \"the only profession where you can actually physically discriminate.\"\n\nYANG: Oh, yeah.\n\nSANDERS: It's like they're night and day.\n\nYANG: You know, when I auditioned for \"Crazy Rich Asians\" I called my manager. I'm like, this is, like, a very important movie for us.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: I know I'm usually the quirky, you know, sidekick guy or whatever, but let me just go try to read for the lead role. I don't care.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, look at you.\n\nYANG: Like, this is...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...Really special for us and I'm very confident my acting ability. I'm like, let me audition for the lead role.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And my manager's just like, look; I don't know how to tell you this, but they're looking for a good-looking guy for the lead role (laughter).\n\nSANDERS: He said that?\n\nYANG: Yes. And I totally understood what he meant.\n\nSANDERS: No, you should have fired your manager.\n\nYANG: No. Like, I get it. Like, I'm a fairly decent-looking guy in real life. But my type is not the good-looking, chiseled man. You feel me? Like, my agent used to always tell me, you have a good look. And I was, like, OK. Cool. I have a good look. But then I realized having a good look is different than being good-looking.\n\nSANDERS: Oh.\n\nYANG: Like, Ryan Gosling is good-looking. Me and Luis Guzman...\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: ...Have a good look. You know, like, I look like the computer person...\n\nSANDERS: OK (laughter).\n\nYANG: ...Or like the college kid. Luis Guzman look like, you know, papi. He looks like...\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: ...The drug dealer...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...Sometimes in his movies, right?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So we have a good look.\n\nSANDERS: A good look.\n\nYANG: We rely on...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...A good look...\n\nSANDERS: Yes.\n\nYANG: ...Whereas other people are just good-looking.\n\nSANDERS: Got you. Yeah. I want to talk more about the acting world...\n\nYANG: Yes.\n\nSANDERS: ...And how you got there.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: Briefly walk through from you just paying $5 to get five minutes of stage time to do comedy to, like, landing a role on an HBO show. Like, you kind of struggled in the wilderness for a while. You were doing this comedy stuff. You end up in San Diego again.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: And then you end up - by virtue of liking one of your fellow comics, you end up deejaying at a strip club.\n\nYANG: Uh-huh (ph). That's true.\n\nSANDERS: That is - and you wanted to do that.\n\nYANG: I think everybody that grew up watching...\n\nSANDERS: No, no, no, that's...\n\nYANG: ...Too much Ludacris music videos want to go work at a - deejay at a strip - that seems so glamorous, like, in our pop culture, in a way.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: Or especially for a stupid, 22-year-old kid.\n\nSANDERS: But the...\n\nYANG: But it's not.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: It's not, especially the strip club I worked at. It was really seedy. It was ran by gangsters. I had to work there on Christmas. Like, it was bad. And, you know, it was a really just dark vibe. I was delivering the cashbox to the owner's house every night. I could've gotten shot. And, yeah, it was just a bad environment. And that was the reason why I had to really leave San Diego.\n\nSANDERS: Well, because one of your comedy friends was like, you've got to get the hell out of there.\n\nYANG: Yeah. Like, my mentor Sean Kelly, he was, like, dude, you got to get out. Like, this is not you. You're a good kid, you know?\n\nSANDERS: Uh-huh.\n\nYANG: Go out there. Go back to LA...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...And go pursue that. And I'm, like, yo, you're right.\n\nSANDERS: And you did.\n\nYANG: And I quit.\n\nSANDERS: You just decided that you wanted to try comedy again or do acting or what?\n\nYANG: I've been doing comedy.\n\nSANDERS: Yes.\n\nYANG: I got my chops working at the Comedy Palace at the door and, like, get some stage time in San Diego now. So I'm - I have a good 15 minutes at this point...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...You know?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: But I'm like, how am I going to make money? All my strip club savings I'm putting into rent. I'm renting this guy's...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...Living room from Craigslist...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...Three hundred bucks a month. So I'm like, OK. I need to do some commercials. So how do you do that? I don't know. How do you become an actor?\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter) I have no idea.\n\nYANG: I don't know.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So I asked all my comedian friends who has just been on one commercial or been an extra in...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...The back of a movie.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...And they were telling me all the tips. They're like, go sign up on all the dot-coms - on LA Casting, Actors Access, whatever...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...All the casting websites. Put your headshot up there.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: Put your stand-up reel up there.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: You know, so I did that. And then I got a couple interviews from really small agencies, right?\n\nSANDERS: Uh-huh.\n\nYANG: My first agent's interview, I was, like, oh, my God. I'm going to make it.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: You know? That to me was like CAA calling me.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: And then I went there. The agency was in an apartment rental office.\n\nSANDERS: Runaway.\n\nYANG: Exactly. But I was so desperate, I was still trying to impress them. They had me read this Staples commercial.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: And I was so bad they're, like, thank you and never talked to me again.\n\nSANDERS: Never talked to you again.\n\nYANG: I was rejected by apartment rental office acting agent.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter) That's rough. That's LA, though.\n\nYANG: Oh, my God.\n\nSANDERS: I mean, the stories of rejection in this town are enough to make you cry.\n\nYANG: Exactly. And everybody has been to Central Casting their first day off that Greyhound bus, you know?\n\nSANDERS: The Greyhound bus - man.\n\nYANG: And it was just sad. I was just - oh, my God. I'm, like, OK. I guess I'll try to grind it out doing stand-up, and maybe I should just give up at some point...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...Go back to get a finance job.\n\nSANDERS: But then there was one agent.\n\nYANG: There was one agent - very small agency in Manhattan Beach.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: And she called me, like, because she saw my - she's the one that said, I think you've got a good look.\n\nSANDERS: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.\n\nYANG: And I'm, like, OK. Whatever. I don't even know what that means.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: I went and met up with her. And she was very honest. She was, like, look; I don't know if I can get you work, but I think you've got a good look. I'll submit some of your headshots.\n\nSANDERS: Uh-huh.\n\nYANG: And if it don't work out, you don't get called for the audition, so we can go our separate ways.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: And at that point, once again, I've got nothing to lose.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYANG: I'm, like, sure.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: Please sign me.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And then she starts sending me out. Like, she really believed me. I guess I did have a good look, you know? And I auditioned for, like, \"Modern Family\" - just, like, two-line parts - and, like, commercials that I really wanted to audition for. But money was running out, and I wasn't booking any of these jobs. And auditioning is, like, a totally different sport than acting.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, I'm sure.\n\nYANG: And now I have to put in whatever money I have left or whatever money I earn from doing stand-up into acting classes...\n\nSANDERS: Huh.\n\nYANG: ...To just kind of know what I'm doing.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nYANG: Maybe naturally, I'm a pretty good actor...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...But it's still...\n\nSANDERS: It's a science in its...\n\nYANG: Yeah, there's a science to it, especially...\n\nSANDERS: And there's...\n\nYANG: ...Audition process.\n\nSANDERS: Well, there's a language that you did not know. What was the thing that they say - slate your name or...\n\nYANG: Slate your name - what the hell is slate?\n\nSANDERS: Why don't they just say, say your name? Who are you?\n\nYANG: Just say, say your name.\n\nSANDERS: What does the slate even mean?\n\nYANG: They say - I don't know. I still don't know.\n\nSANDERS: They say, slate your name, and you don't know what that means.\n\nYANG: Yeah. Basically, that just means, I'm Jimmy O. Yang, and I'm 5'6\".\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: You know?\n\nSANDERS: So you do the audition live, and then you end up auditioning for an HBO pilot which at first was called - what? It wasn't called \"Silicon Valley\" first.\n\nYANG: It was called \"DeepTech.\"\n\nSANDERS: \"DeepTech.\"\n\nYANG: I don't know if this is, like, top secret, but I wrote in my book. The show was called \"DeepTech\" before it was ever called \"Silicon Valley.\"\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And...\n\nSANDERS: And you do the audition.\n\nYANG: I do the audition.\n\nSANDERS: You think nothing of it. It happens. And then you find out once you get the show that the guy that created the show, Mike Judge, was your commencement speaker.\n\nYANG: That's my guy.\n\nSANDERS: ...At UCSD.\n\nYANG: Yep.\n\nSANDERS: And he was one of the big inspirations for you that made you want to not do, like, finance stuff.\n\nYANG: Absolutely.\n\nSANDERS: That's crazy, right? Tell us the whole story.\n\nYANG: Mike Judge, the guy that created \"Beavis and Butt-Head,\" \"King Of The Hill,\" of course \"Silicon Valley\"...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...He was my commencement speaker at UCSD. And he also went to UCSD.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And he kind of shared the same experience I did. He didn't really enjoy college too much. He was a physics major. The dude's really smart. He ended up programming, like, computer chips on fighter jets or something like that. But he just hated that whole culture, the corporate culture. And that's why he wrote \"Office Space,\" right?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And then he was like, I just need to find a passion. So I quit - he quit this job. And then he came back around. When he found animation, he knew he found that thing that ticks. And he knew he found his passion. And he just grinded it out, you know, in a basement or in his garage, making \"Beavis and Butt-Head,\" making his first animatic.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And as a lost college student at that moment, not knowing what I wanted to do - all I knew was I didn't want to do economics, the thing that I majored in. And this is permission that my parents never gave me. And I'm like - just seeing a living example of a man that I actually know his name from Hollywood, TV shows and movies - making it. And in the same exact shoe I was - went to the same exact college. It doesn't seem like a far-fetched inspirational story.\n\nSANDERS: You can do it.\n\nYANG: It seems like this could be me.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. Well, you know, you have this line in the book and in that story. You say, part of what Mike Judge was kind of saying was, quote, \"pursue what you love, not what you should.\"\n\nYANG: Absolutely. And that's still what I believe in because to me it's so scary - maybe it's fear that led me to it because I'm sure there's a lot of people that settle into a job that they should be doing - right? - that their parents tell them...\n\nSANDERS: Which is no shame on that.\n\nYANG: No shame on that. And some people are cool with that. And they're very happy doing it. I wish I was that guy, right? You know, I'll probably have two kids and be very happy, probably - maybe happier than I am now. But for me, it was the fear - like, I was so scared working behind a desk and being stuck behind a desk - that I really cannot do it anymore. And it's, you know, that speech that really spoke to me. And boom, five years later, I auditioned for \"Silicon Valley.\"\n\nSANDERS: And then it happens.\n\nYANG: And then it happens. It didn't happen right away. You know, I - the part was a guest star part with three lines or something.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. I eat the fish.\n\nYANG: And they called me - yeah. And then they called me back. That was the second episode, was the I eat the fish. The third episode was just me saying no and no, like, three times to T.J. Those three episodes I was in the first season, I got paid 900 bucks per episode at SAG minimum scale.\n\nSANDERS: So for the whole first season of HBO's \"Silicon Valley,\" you got - what? - $2,700.\n\nYANG: Twenty-seven hundred dollars. And I used that as a down payment on a 2006 Prius so I can drive Uber.\n\nSANDERS: Stop.\n\nYANG: I was driving Uber between Season 1 and 2 of \"Silicon Valley.\"\n\nSANDERS: Do you still have the Prius?\n\nYANG: Oh, no. I gave it to my brother.\n\nSANDERS: OK, look at you - good sibling.\n\nYANG: Yeah, so he could drive Uber.\n\nSANDERS: What are you driving now?\n\nYANG: I have a Lexus, a lease.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, OK. OK, I see you.\n\nYANG: No, it's an entry-level - IS 200. It's a very - a four-cylinder car. You know, it's just a write-off. That's why - that's why I have it.\n\nSANDERS: One more break here. When we come back, more about \"Silicon Valley\" and how Jimmy deals with success. All right, BRB.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")\n\nSANDERS: For our listeners who are not watching \"Silicon Valley,\" describe your character for them.\n\nYANG: So Jian-Yang, the character that I play, is a geek, is a computer programmer, just like everybody else on the show. And he's an immigrant, also. But in a way, he's kind of brave. And I kind of like him because he's - one article wrote this term. It said he's kind of like an anti-assimilation character. Because for me, for so long in my life being an immigrant, I tried to - try as hard as I could to be American.\n\nJian-Yang doesn't care. He thinks he's cool the way he is. And he's kind of - as the seasons go on becomes kind of evil. And he becomes kind of like a pain in the butt for a lot of people. So it's very interesting to play this person who you think is a docile, stereotypical immigrant, but he actually has a pretty sharp comeback to a lot of things and a dark side to him.\n\nSANDERS: There was something you said about playing that role that really stuck out to me. Like, the kind of mantra for that character, was it I don't know anything?\n\nYANG: Oh, yeah. So he has a...\n\nSANDERS: Is that the right phrase?\n\nYANG: Yes. I don't know. And I always say the mantra to myself in Mandarin. It's (speaking Mandarin) - right? - which means I don't know because first of all, I have to practice thinking in Mandarin a little more with this character because I want that accent to be authentic. I want it to sound like one of my uncles or like my mother, you know? And it's a very specific Mandarin accent. It's not just like a cliche, Cantonese, Bruce Lee accent, right? So I just want it to be a real person.\n\nSo every day I go to the Sony lot to shoot the show. I listen to 1300 AM, the Mandarin station, for, like, an hour. And then I try to just think in Mandarin. And I was thinking this mantra (speaking Mandarin) - I don't know, I don't know. And I think in that because that's the bane of his existence. First of all, it's the Mandarin. Second of all, it's I don't know - either he actually doesn't know what's going on like me back in the day when I didn't know what what's up meant, or he actually just doesn't care to know.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: You know?\n\nSANDERS: And he's probably like - I mean, I'm sure that so much of the immigrant experience when there's a language barrier is just being frustrated that people don't understand you.\n\nYANG: Exactly. And what's great about Jian-Yang it's like he kind of doesn't care that he's like, you know, frustrating other people. And a lot of the jokes - even like the I eat the fish scene with T.J.'s character, which became, like, my nemesis on the show...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...And we had a great dynamic. When he gets mad at me doing certain things, the joke's kind of on him being an impatient, you know, buffoonish, big American guy. And Jian-Yang kind of gets the upper hand throughout the season. And I kind of love it. Like, you don't have to fight fire with fire. He's just very chill, you know?\n\nSANDERS: It is a subversive portrayal of an immigrant.\n\nYANG: Yes.\n\nSANDERS: It like - he knows what the hell's going on.\n\nYANG: Oh, he knows what's going on.\n\nSANDERS: And he's going to win.\n\nYANG: Exactly. And especially this season, as you guys see, he - yeah. He gets kind of evil, too.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: Did you expect the show to be as big of a hit as it is? Did you...\n\nYANG: Not...\n\nSANDERS: ...How's it been?\n\nYANG: Not at all when I first auditioned for it. You know, I knew Mike Judge is, like, serious business. But I don't - 'cause there are just so many TV programs out there. Like, so many shows - like, everybody's, like, almost a serious regular on the show now. But there are so many shows that people just don't watch. And I'm so fortunate that this is a show that gets attention from the award circuit. And people are actually watching. And this is my first show.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah, dude.\n\nYANG: How amazing is that? Like, I count my blessings every day.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And it's been incredible. And it happened really fast.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: But also it happened when I'm a little older. It didn't happen when I was, like, 20.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So I was a little - I, like, I know what's going on. I didn't let it get to my head. And my issue was not knowing what to do with myself. Like...\n\nSANDERS: What do you mean?\n\nYANG: ...Like, I still have pretty low self-esteem. I still try to go to Ross instead of, like, Nordstrom.\n\nSANDERS: Ain't nothing wrong with Ross.\n\nYANG: You know, like, because...\n\nSANDERS: And listen; and a Nordstrom Rack will top a Nordstrom any GD day.\n\nYANG: I have never bought anything at Nordstrom except for those pair of pants I bought for the Arsenio Hall Show. I thought I went all out.\n\nSANDERS: I got lunch one day at the Nordstrom restaurant, but that's it.\n\nYANG: Oh, yeah?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: Yeah. There you go.\n\nSANDERS: But Nordstrom Rack is the jam. Ross is the jam. You can - hold on to that.\n\nYANG: Why would you go to Nordstrom when there's Nordstrom Rack?\n\nSANDERS: Literally.\n\nYANG: So like...\n\nSANDERS: So you still are trying to convince yourself that you're worth it.\n\nYANG: Yeah. And this year has been - gotten better, like, because I'm doing more - other stuff that's not - just because this is one thing that I started off as such a small part. I still in a sense think that I'm that guest-star side actor, you know, whenever I see myself there. But then, you know, I wrote the book.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: You know, I'm in a couple of movies. So that kind of - as an artist, my self-esteem is rising a little bit.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: You know, and it's starting to match, like, who I am, which is great.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And, you know, so...\n\nSANDERS: I know that there are a lot of people listening who probably feel or have felt the same way - a little bit of imposter syndrome.\n\nYANG: Exactly.\n\nSANDERS: Do I deserve this? Give folks some advice on getting through that.\n\nYANG: Well, first of all, it's good to have imposter syndrome.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, OK.\n\nYANG: It's fine. It keeps you humble.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: And it keeps you that wonderment - that awe that we talk about.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah, yeah.\n\nYANG: Like earlier, when I first came to America - like every time I go to, like, a Emmys after-party...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...I see Bryan Cranston there, like, whoever, like, Jon Snow, Kit Harrington.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: I'm still fanboying on the inside. And that feels good.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: That feels great.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: You don't want that to go away.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: You know, and the best feeling was, like - for example, Ken Jeong. I've been a fan of Ken Jeong.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, yeah.\n\nYANG: And I wanted to visit his show \"Dr. Ken,\" which is now unfortunately canceled. And he fanboyed over me more than I fanboyed over him. I was, like, freaking out inside. And then he was like, Tran. He grabbed his wife Tran. He was like, Tran, come on. Come over. It's Jimmy. We've got to take a picture with Jimmy. And that is the coolest feeling ever. You don't ever want that to go away.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: You know, so it's kind of good to live in that imposter syndrome and to approach this as an outsider instead of, you know, saying, I'm Hollywood. I deserve this.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: I'm - like, you know, it's good to know that maybe artistically, maybe in your craft you're as good as some of these people, and that's why you're here. And be confident with your craft. But keep that sense of wonderment.\n\nSANDERS: I like that. I'm sure that what must also help you kind of get to a place of satisfaction is, like, knowing that your dad is a bit more supportive of you now, so much so...\n\nYANG: Slightly.\n\nSANDERS: ...Yeah. You even - so supportive that you even got him in a movie.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: Tell that story.\n\nYANG: My dad started acting. I don't know if it's out of support.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: It's a little bit out of spite. He was like, oh, it's so easy. You can do it. I can probably do it.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: Because I'm sure, just like everyone else, deep down there's a part of him always wanted to be an actor.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: But, you know, just like how he taught me - he didn't think it was possible.\n\nSANDERS: Well, also because, like, in Hong Kong, in China...\n\nYANG: You can't just get up and be an actor.\n\nSANDERS: It's different acting. There is no such thing as stand-up there really, right?\n\nYANG: Exactly. There's...\n\nSANDERS: So he couldn't conceptualize what you were doing for a while.\n\nYANG: Right. He still calls stand-up a talk show.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: Because that's not really a thing back in the day in China.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So he was like, it's so easy. You can do it. I can do it. I'm like, OK. You know what? This is a perfect time for me to show you how hard acting is.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: How hard the audition process is.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: So I'm like - so I call my agent. I'm like, do you need an old Asian person on your roster?\n\nSANDERS: Wait. That - wait. Stop right there. One, that is unbelievable to me. You just called an agent being like, give my dad some work.\n\nYANG: Well, still that smaller agent, right?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So I'm like, my dad has a good look.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: So the - you know, can you sign up...\n\nSANDERS: Did you just say that your dad's not good-looking?\n\nYANG: Hey. I didn't say that.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: I just said he had a good look, OK? So (laughter) I'm like, do you - maybe you can send him out on some commercials. Just so - to teach him a lesson.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So he can see how hard this is. And she was like, yeah. You know what? Actually, I could use an Asian dude on my roster - old Asian dude because there's only, like, two old Asian people in Hollywood, right?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So my dad could have been, like, one of the pre-eminent old Asian dudes. And then the plan completely backfired because he started booking everything.\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: He booked his first four out of his six auditions, which is unheard of.\n\nSANDERS: He ended up in a show that was popular back in China?\n\nYANG: Yeah, he ended a show called \"Big Daddy (ph)\" that, like, is, like, one of the most popular shows in China.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, my goodness.\n\nYANG: When they shot it, we didn't think much of it because we were like, we've never heard of the show; whatever.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYANG: And it's, like, a billion people watching it in China. My aunt called our house here in LA, and she was like, Richard, you're so good in the show. Your son must have taken after you. Did you teach him how to act?\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: I'm like, man, come on, man.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So he was like, oh, it is easy, huh? There's nothing special about what you did.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. So you and your dad were actually in a movie together.\n\nYANG: \"Patriots Day.\"\n\nSANDERS: Which is about...\n\nYANG: Which is about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the tragedy and the heroes and the victims of it.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: Like, it's really a heavy movie, and it's my first dramatic role.\n\nSANDERS: And you play a really pivotal role in the movie.\n\nYANG: I play this guy Dun Meng, who is also a Chinese immigrant, and he kind of saved the day. He's the unsung hero of that marathon bombing because he got carjacked and kidnapped by the Tsarnaev terrorist brothers.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And he made a brave, heroic escape at gunpoint.\n\nSANDERS: He just jump out of the car.\n\nYANG: Ran out to a gas station and called the police.\n\nSANDERS: That's - that is bravery.\n\nYANG: And that's how they led the police to tracking down that car and tracking down the two terrorists.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And I was so proud to play that role.\n\nSANDERS: I bet.\n\nYANG: And the whole time Pete Berg, the director, and Mark Wahlberg, the star and the producer, was like, we got to get this right. This movie's not about us. It's about the heroes and the victims.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...And we got to get everything authentic and right.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So I get to hang out with Danny - Dun Meng - every day, I was in Boston.\n\nSANDERS: The real-life Dun Meng, yeah.\n\nYANG: Yeah And I was bugging him about what happened, and he was so nice, and he's one of the kindest people ever.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So I was just - want to get it right. And then there's a scene with him Skyping with his dad back home in China - or his parents. And the dad they had casted had a Cantonese accent when he spoke Mandarin. Now...\n\nSANDERS: Which is a no-no.\n\nYANG: Right. Like, to American audience or to most audiences, they wouldn't know what's going on. But to me, if I want to keep it authentic, I want to make it my job to keep it authentic...\n\nSANDERS: Got to keep it 100.\n\nYANG: ...And what I know, right?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So I went up to Pete. I'm like, this guy speaks, you know, Mandarin in a Cantonese accent. It's just not right.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And the mom speaks in a different, you know, accent because she speaks proper Mandarin. And then he was like, OK, good, let's get you a new dad; I'm glad you said something. And I'm like, Pete, I was sitting...\n\nSANDERS: That poor guy (laughter).\n\nYANG: Yeah, whatever. So then I sat in at the casting sessions. I offered Pete to sit in. I'm like, I'll sit in your casting sessions.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And I'll make sure, you know, the person's authentic.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: And then I had this lightbulb moment. I'm like, you know what? Why don't you guys just cast my dad? He's an actor.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYANG: He's a real actor.\n\nSANDERS: He's union. Yeah.\n\nYANG: And he speaks Mandarin very authentically. And then Pete was like, done, get him out here. And I got my dad his first union SAG job.\n\nSANDERS: That is some full circle. So you go from having a father that is mad that you don't become, like, a doctor, an engineer or a finance guy, mad you're doing stand-up, mad you're trying to act. And then he is in a movie with you.\n\nYANG: Because I hooked him up.\n\nSANDERS: You've got to hook it up.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: That's amazing.\n\nYANG: And that was one of the best experiences to kind of be behind the cameras when my dad is acting.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...And knowing that - like, you know, at that moment, I think he was pretty proud.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, I'm sure he was.\n\nYANG: And at the \"Patriots Day\" premiere...\n\nSANDERS: Oh, I bet.\n\nYANG: ...You know, I think he was proud. He's still telling everybody, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, my son's in \"Patriots Day,\" but did you know I...\n\nSANDERS: (Laughter).\n\nYANG: ...I was in \"Patriots Day\" also? You know, so he's still kind of bragging. But, like, you know what? I'm happy.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: I'm happy that he's happy about it, you know?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. So OK, you're 30 years old. You are doing comedy on \"Arsenio Hall.\" You're in major motion pictures. You're on a hit HBO show. You got your dad in the biz. I'm sure someone at your age who has accomplished this much could say, all right, I'm good; whatever else happens, I'm good.\n\nYANG: Right.\n\nSANDERS: But I'm guessing you have some other challenges lined up for yourself, some other goals to accomplish.\n\nYANG: Absolutely. I think...\n\nSANDERS: What is next for you? What else do you want to do?\n\nYANG: I think this is the fun part, where people are finally paying attention to who I am...\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: ...And my projects that I want to do.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So I want to do more writing...\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: ...Screenwriting.\n\nSANDERS: OK.\n\nYANG: And I want to turn this book into, like, a TV show or a movie or something...\n\nSANDERS: Ah.\n\nYANG: ...And just kind of take it to the next level, man, and start creating what I want, right? 'Cause I think, at the end of the day, like, artists become who they are because, you know, we love creating stuff, you know? Even, like, building Legos felt great to me.\n\nSANDERS: Yeah.\n\nYANG: So, like, this is where it gets fun. It's not like, oh, I did my job; I can go to Hawaii and chill out now, you know? It's not.\n\nSANDERS: Now you get to...\n\nYANG: Like, this is where it gets exciting. This is the fun part.\n\nSANDERS: OK. So that means you're going to make a rap album, too.\n\nYANG: Yes. I'm making a rap song with Too $hort right now.\n\nSANDERS: Rap some of your lyrics.\n\nYANG: No, no, I didn't rap. I just made the beat.\n\nSANDERS: Oh, my goodness. Is it on YouTube?\n\nYANG: Not yet. It's going to come out soon.\n\nSANDERS: OK. OK.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: I'm ready for it.\n\nYANG: It's Too $hort, Dumbfoundead, which is, like, one of the most legit Asian rappers, and Awkwafina, my homie.\n\nSANDERS: Awkwafina.\n\nYANG: Yeah, yeah. So it's going to be a really sick song.\n\nSANDERS: I love it. I'm not going to ask you to accompany me right now to El Pollo Loco.\n\nYANG: (Laughter).\n\nSANDERS: ...But one day.\n\nYANG: Yes. We should exchange info.\n\nSANDERS: One day.\n\nYANG: You are so great.\n\nSANDERS: Thanks, man.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\nSANDERS: Well, I'm in LA. We - seriously, we'll go to El Pollo Loco.\n\nYANG: Let's do it. Let's do it.\n\nSANDERS: ...Any friggin' (ph) time.\n\nYANG: Yeah.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")\n\nSANDERS: Jimmy O.
