SAM SANDERS, HOST:

From NPR, I'm Sam Sanders. IT'S BEEN A MINUTE. Today on the show - Jimmy O. Yang, the actor and comedian. Lot of you might know him for his work on HBO's "Silicon Valley." Jimmy plays Jian-Yang on the show, this misfit immigrant programmer. Besides his work on "Silicon Valley," Jimmy is out with a new book. It's called "How To American: An Immigrant's Guide To Disappointing Your Parents." The book's all about how Jimmy grew up in America as an immigrant after moving to LA from Hong Kong when he was 13.

We talk about how Jimmy tried to make it in stand-up comedy, how he worked really, really hard to kind of not choose the path that his immigrant parents wanted for him. And we talk a lot about representation and what it means to be an Asian man on screen today. Fun fact - Jimmy is starring in a new movie. Fun fact - Jimmy's in a new movie coming out later this year. It's called "Crazy Rich Asians," and it's already being called Asian-Americans' very own "Black Panther."

So in this discussion of representation, Jimmy also talks about what it means to play roles with an accent, like he does on "Silicon Valley." Here he is playing his character, Jian-Yang.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, "SILICON VALLEY")

JIMMY O YANG: (As Jian-Yang) I eat the fish.

T J MILLER: (As Erlich Bachman) I understand you eat the fish. But when you clean the fish, you can't just leave the fish head and guts and [expletive] in the sink because the whole house smells like a bait station. So you got to put it in the trash and then take the trash out. Do you understand?

YANG: (As Jian-Yang) Yes, I eat the fish.

SANDERS: So that was a clip of Jimmy with one of his former "Silicon Valley" co-stars, T.J. Miller. T.J. Miller himself - he has been in the news a bit lately for some very erratic behavior and some allegations of sexual assault. But we're going to leave that alone and just focus on Jimmy for this conversation. All right, before we get into this chat, a quick warning - if you're listening to this with kids, Jimmy's amazingly fun and captivating personal story does have a bit to do with the world of adult entertainment. So there's that. All right, here's me talking with Jimmy O. Yang in our Culver City studio.

(SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' "FLICKER")

SANDERS: I finished your book last night.

YANG: Thank you so much.

SANDERS: You're funny.

YANG: Thanks.

SANDERS: You're funny. So I was going to, in preparation for this interview, do something, and then I was like, no, it's too weird. I was going to go to El Pollo Loco...

YANG: Oh, man.

SANDERS: ...And get a bunch of the salsas...

YANG: Dude.

SANDERS: ...And have you tell me which one's your favorite.

YANG: You know, I can tell you each one of the salsas without looking at it.

SANDERS: OK, go.

YANG: It's the green guacamole one.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: That one's by far my favorite.

SANDERS: Why?

YANG: Because it's watery. It's a little - it's...

SANDERS: I don't believe in watery guacamole, bruh (ph).

YANG: But - exactly. But it's a salsa, so it's OK. They don't try to sell you as guacamole. It's all about how you look at it. It's OK.

SANDERS: That's a good rule for life, huh?

YANG: You know?

SANDERS: So I bring this up because there's this wonderful story about your grandfather introducing you to America through the wonders and joys of El Pollo Loco. Can you tell that story? Because it's so good.

YANG: The first day me and my father and my whole family came to America - my grandpa has been living here for a few years already.

SANDERS: In LA.

YANG: Yeah, in LA. So he kind of knows his way around. He's like, I'm going to take you guys to my favorite American restaurant.

SANDERS: And you came here at 13 from Hong Kong.

YANG: Exactly.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: So grandpa walked us down La Cienega Boulevard, and it was like...

SANDERS: Which is a street you don't walk down.

YANG: You don't.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: But in Hong Kong, or even in Shanghai, where my grandpa's from, you walk down everything, right?

SANDERS: Yeah, yeah.

YANG: So he has kind of no concept of how far to walk. And we end up walking down 45 minutes of just nothing but strip malls and six-lane traffic down La Cienega.

SANDERS: Where on La Cienega were you?

YANG: It was La Cienega by, like, Olympic.

SANDERS: Oh, ugh. OK.

YANG: ...That massive intersection.

SANDERS: Yeah, why would you do that?

YANG: Took 45 minutes to walk, like - I don't know - like, 2 miles to another massive strip mall with, like, a LA Fitness and everything. And I don't even know what that is. I have no concept of gyms.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...Because I came from Hong Kong. Everybody was skinny.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: And we walked our calories off. We didn't have to go to the gym.

SANDERS: Or we're outside at the park at 6 in the morning doing your stretches. Is that happening over there?

YANG: That happens everywhere.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: What are they doing? Anywhere you go, there's 250 old Asian people at 6 a.m. stretching.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: It's crazy.

SANDERS: I don't know how much of this makes the cut, but I love it. So keep going. You're walking down La Cienega...

YANG: Walking down La Cienega - after 45 minutes in this massive strip mall, my grandpa, like - this is my favorite restaurant in America. It's authentic Mexican food, and you cannot find this in China. And I looked up, and it said, El Pollo Loco.

SANDERS: And we should point out, it is a downscale, fast food, Mexican drive-through chain.

YANG: Yeah.

SANDERS: So you go in there. What is it like for you?

YANG: The cash register person was asking my grandpa, do you want dark meat or white meat? And then my grandpa had to explain to us, you always order the dark meat. That's the good part of chicken - the wings, the thighs...

SANDERS: (Snapping) Agree. Agree.

YANG: ...The legs.

SANDERS: I can't with the dry breast.

YANG: Yeah. And he said, the white meat is rough. That's for, like, you know, dumb American people. I'm like, OK.

SANDERS: So you didn't have the chance to choose what part of the chicken you got back home.

YANG: I didn't have to choose. And really, even in Hong Kong, we ordered, like, the Hainanese chicken and all that. And my dad always either got the back or, like, the leg. Nobody ever gets the breast, OK?

SANDERS: Really?

YANG: So I already kind of know...

SANDERS: You knew what's up.

YANG: ...That the breast ain't the business.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: And then there's just all these little customs that I wasn't used to. Like, in Hong Kong, you order whatever soda you want. They get it for you behind the register. Here, you get a soda, you get a water, and you go refill it yourself. And my grandpa whispered to us - he was like, hey, just get the water, OK? Because here you can just get the water and then go get soda yourself.

SANDERS: Wait, wait, whoa - you...

YANG: But never buy the soda because that's how they make their money.

SANDERS: ...You can't do that.

YANG: Well, grandpa did it. I didn't know you can just turn water into Dr. Pepper in this country. And then you walk over to the salsa bar. My grandpa was like, yo, just take - take anything you want. And I'm like, what do you mean? Like, we don't have to pay for this? He's like no - no, just take anything you want.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: And I'm like, yo, this country is amazing. So that was, like, my first experience, not just with food in America but with American freedom.

SANDERS: American freedom, courtesy of El Pollo Loco.

YANG: Absolutely.

SANDERS: So - I love that. OK. So you have been here now since you were 13. How old are you now?

YANG: Thirty.

SANDERS: Thirty.

YANG: Yeah.

SANDERS: Do you still have that same sense of what read to me in the book as this inherent amazement with all that America is? Has some of that worn off for you?

YANG: Some of it, of course. With age, it kind of goes away, like the sense of innocence, seeing everything with a new lens. But now I try to go to other countries with that lens, even going back to Hong Kong. I went back to Hong Kong for the first time in 17 years and I was culture shocked in Hong Kong.

SANDERS: You're home.

YANG: Like, I was culture shocked - yeah. It's the opposite of what I felt when I came here when I was 13. The streets - I'm not used to the streets being this narrow now. I'm not used to people rubbing my - shoulder to shoulder. I'm not used to walking after a meal to take the subway, you know? And - everything - just the language. And - but it felt good.

SANDERS: Yeah?

YANG: It was a good culture shock...

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: ...Because after just a couple days of that initial shock, I found myself being very comfortable and at ease. Like, the weight of being a minority, just being something different in this country, was gone. I was just a dude.

SANDERS: You're just a dude.

YANG: I didn't have to be, like, the Asian dude or...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...Like, be careful of, oh, let's try to not drive a Honda Accord and go to dim sum and play pingpong because that's stereotypical here.

SANDERS: Listen, I would live that life.

YANG: Yeah, but...

SANDERS: That'd be a wonderful day for me.

YANG: Yeah, and - and that life in Hong Kong, you're just a normal dude.

SANDERS: You just do it.

YANG: It's not a stereotype until you come here, you know?

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So I just felt at ease, man.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: I could have done whatever I wanted, whatever I liked. And I was just a dude.

SANDERS: You know, hearing you talk about that, it makes me think of this movie you're going to be in soon, "Crazy Rich Asians..."

YANG: Yes.

SANDERS: ...Where it seems like you get to just be a dude because the entire cast is Asian.

YANG: Absolutely.

SANDERS: And the buzz around it is phenomenal already. Describe this film for folks that haven't heard about it yet.

YANG: So "Crazy Rich Asians" is based on a book by Kevin Kwan called "Crazy Rich Asians." There's three books. So if this movie does well, maybe there will be a trilogy.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: But most importantly, it's the first movie in 25 years - first studio picture in 25 years - since "Joy Luck Club" that features a full Asian cast.

SANDERS: It's like y'all's "Black Panther..."

YANG: Yeah, see...

SANDERS: ...But not.

YANG: ...I said that on Twitter. People got mad at me.

SANDERS: Wait, they got - who...

YANG: I'm like this is going to be our "Black Panther" - obviously, jokingly...

SANDERS: ...Yes.

YANG: ...Because the two movies are nothing alike (unintelligible).

SANDERS: Well, yeah.

YANG: But for me it's like - I hope - basically, with that statement, I'm saying I hope it's going to be a box office success...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...And the cultural representation that "Black Panther" is.

SANDERS: Yes.

YANG: And then black people were tweeting me. They were mad. They tell me shut the F up. And they're telling me, like, why is it, like, whenever black people got a little bit of shine, y'all got to try to take it for yourself? I'm like, what - what are you talking about?

SANDERS: Twitter is bad.

YANG: Yeah. And then Asian people are like, yo, this movie, it could stand on its own. Like, we don't have to compare it, like - and diminished both of the movies. And I'm like, oh, my God.

SANDERS: What does it feel to make a movie like this, that is, in many ways, groundbreaking but is also entering this cultural moment right now...

YANG: Yes.

SANDERS: ...Where it seems everyone is always mad about everything before it's even there? You're already experiencing that with this movie because some people are saying, oh, the portrayal of Asians is too anglicized or too hetero-normative...

YANG: Yup.

SANDERS: ...Or they're all too pretty or whatever - like...

YANG: And you know who's critiquing the hardest, or the critique that I get for my acting career? Asian people. You playing an immigrant on "Silicon Valley" - that makes me look bad, blah, blah, blah - all this, like, you play this accented character. But I try to play everything very authentically, even if it is an accented immigrant, Jian Yang, that I play on "Silicon Valley..."

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...I try to play it - it's just a version of myself when I came to this country when I was 13, and I'm trying to represent my immigrants, you know? So...

SANDERS: Well, you wrote in the book something - you basically said, like, the issue is not the role. The issue is the baggage people feel about these accents themselves.

YANG: Their perception.

SANDERS: Like, why do you feel so bad about the accent?

YANG: And Sofia Vergara is sexy with her accent. Why am I nerdy and weird?

SANDERS: Everyone likes British accents.

YANG: Yeah. Why is it when a white actor or even a black actor does a British accent, it's considered art? It's considered, oh, he did well. Nobody ever gave Chadwick Boseman anything, like, oh, you're doing an African accent. You're misrepresenting African people. But you know what - you know what it is?

SANDERS: What is it?

YANG: And this movie is hopefully going to fix part of that. It's - there's not enough of us out there.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: So everything is being scrutinized. When you're 1 out of 5 Asian people on TV, all the pressure is on you and you have to represent...

SANDERS: Who are the other four?

YANG: ...The whole Asian spectrum.

SANDERS: Who are the other four?

YANG: I can't name - I don't know.

SANDERS: Wait, no - OK. Let's go through...

YANG: Well, there's a few. John Cho is always on TV.

SANDERS: He is always working, yeah.

YANG: Yeah. My boy Ken Jeong is always in movies, TV.

SANDERS: Yeah, he's something.

YANG: He's hilarious - like, comic - as a comedian...

SANDERS: Yeah. Yeah.

YANG: ...I always think funny first.

SANDERS: He's funny.

YANG: Like, you know it's...

SANDERS: Who else is - wait.

YANG: OK.

SANDERS: The list, though - who else? Who else?

YANG: Constance Wu.

SANDERS: Oh, yeah.

YANG: Randall Park. I mean, that whole show, you know, has such - a lot of kids.

SANDERS: True - "Fresh Off the Boat" - yeah, yeah.

YANG: So there are getting more and more now.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: But it's still - it's like "The Problem With Apu," that documentary, you know?

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: It's - it's just 'cause...

SANDERS: This is about "The Simpsons" character.

YANG: He was the most important...

SANDERS: If you're the one, you carry all the weight.

YANG: Exactly. So the problem - it's - it's not enough representation. And hopefully with "Crazy Rich Asians," you get a whole spectrum of Asian. And I felt so good doing that movie 'cause I could - I can just be funny and act a fool...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...Because I'm not representing all Asians. I'm just representing one personality.

SANDERS: But you know some people want you to represent all Asians.

YANG: Well, they want to blame me for something, you know...

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: ...Just 'cause...

SANDERS: Do you ever tweet back? Do you ever write right back, or you just...

YANG: I made the mistake of engaging...

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: ...About a week ago.

SANDERS: What did you do?

YANG: And it was horrible. It was, like, one of the worst experiences...

SANDERS: What happened?

YANG: ...I ever had on Twitter. Just everybody jumped on my case. You know, like, saying this and that - calling me a sellout, calling me - whatever - Uncle Chan or something.

SANDERS: Oh, Lord.

YANG: But like, you know, usually whatever I read, it's very positive.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: I had this girl come up to me after this book signing. It's like, we're very proud of you. You know, your success feel like our success.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: And I felt great about that. And then I have...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...People, like, you know, tweeting me great things or Instagram message. This kid - he's like, I'm 15. I just came from China. I don't speak English very well, and, like, your book is the first book I've read in English without anybody's help.

SANDERS: Really?

YANG: And that's really inspiring, and I hope you keep doing that. So by and large, it's great. And I love all my Asian fans, and they're awesome. But it's this small population of people...

SANDERS: The haters.

YANG: ...That - it's like conspiracy theorists almost...

SANDERS: Really?

YANG: ...'Cause then, like - you know, when they tweet you something nasty, you go on their profile to see who they are, right?

SANDERS: It's never their real picture.

YANG: Never...

SANDERS: It's always some rando (ph) image.

YANG: ...Never their real picture. Yeah, they - one guy tweeted me. They say - 'cause in a Huffington Post article, I'm like, I'm sorry I'm not the good-looking, Chow Yun-fat Asian, you know, but character actors need roles, too. You know what I mean?

SANDERS: But also don't sell yourself short. Don't say that you're not good looking.

YANG: Right. Right. But I'm not good-looking in the movie sense. Like, I'm sorry. I'm not, like, 6'2 and super good-looking. You're going to tell me I can't act, right?

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: Like, I shouldn't be representing you because I ain't this, this, this, right? So then I had people tweeting me. They're like, Hollywood chose you because they know you ain't good-looking. And they want to represent Asian people with your ugly face or whatever...

SANDERS: Oh, my God (laughter).

YANG: ...Because - and then at the end, they're like, because everybody casting you is white, dah-dah-dah (ph).

SANDERS: How do they know who's casting you?

YANG: I know. And then they said...

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: At the end of that tweet, they said F white supremacy. And I'm like, I'm not saying that don't exist out there, but how is that - how does that...

SANDERS: You getting your check. What is supremacist about you getting your check?

YANG: They're talking about white supremacist conspiracy putting me on TV...

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: ...To misrepresent Asian people on purpose. I'm like, what the hell are you talking about?

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: No Ku Klux Klan member anointed me...

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: ...To be the ugly Asian person on TV. OK. You can go do it yourself. God, this makes me so angry. It's like...

SANDERS: I didn't mean to make you so angry. I feel like I riled you up.

YANG: Yeah, I know. It's just...

SANDERS: I hear you. I hear you, though.

YANG: Come on, man.

SANDERS: Let's talk about the book.

YANG: Yes.

SANDERS: The book has the most wonderful title - "How To American: An Immigrant's Guide To Disappointing Your Parents." In 30 seconds, tell folks what this book is going to give them.

YANG: It's going to give you hope.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: No, it's - I hope to give people a little inspiration of this outsider - you know, making it in America, assimilating first day as an immigrant and assimilating, you know, in a job that his parents doesn't believe in.

SANDERS: At all.

YANG: At all. I think it - my dad has been telling me since day one - I was born - being an artist is how you become homeless.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: Pursuing your dreams is...

SANDERS: Oh, yeah.

YANG: ...How you become homeless.

SANDERS: I love even - like, even after you've succeeded, he says - this is, like, the last page of your book - he says, quote, "having you as my son is like winning the lottery - not the Mega Millions jackpot but like a small $20 price." Your dad sounds hilarious.

YANG: That statement sums up exactly who he is, right?

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: Like, he busts my chops all the time.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: He's the joker of the family, but it's funny.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: It's fine. So, like, I...

SANDERS: And I feel like he loves you, from what I read in the book.

YANG: Absolutely. It's a complicated relationship. We love each other. But sometimes I wish he's more like that dad or that mom that's just like, I'm so proud of you. I love you, but that's not...

SANDERS: That ain't him.

YANG: Culturally...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...That's not it, and that's not him.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: But deep down, I know he loves me.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: Yeah.

SANDERS: And so the book deals a lot with your relationship with him and with your mother, but it's focused, really, on what it's like for you to come to America at 13. So you - one, you come from Hong Kong, which is China but not quite. And you're already kind of an outsider there because you speak a different dialect from other folks.

YANG: Right.

SANDERS: So you come to the U.S. at 13 - to LA, which is totally different. And you were already marginalized back home, and now you're, like, extra, extra standing out. Like, describe those first few - like, describe that first day at school.

YANG: It was tough, looking back at it.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: But going through it, it was like - wow, this is kind of amazing but scary at the same time.

SANDERS: Well, 'cause there was even points, like, you didn't even know what to say when someone said what's up.

YANG: Yeah. I just looked up in the sky...

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: ...For like five seconds. I'm like, what are you talking about? And the girl was like, what's up? And I looked up. I'm like, nothing. There's nothing up there, and then she had to explain to me what's up meant how are you doing. And I was this foreign kid that just got dumped into a new country with a new language...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...With a new culture. I never met no black people, white people, Latino people.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: I've only hung out with Chinese people back home.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: Even the Asian people here weren't Chinese. They were Koreans. So I, like - I had nowhere to go where I can find, like, a safety zone. I was forced to assimilate with everyone...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...Which, in a way, is a blessing in disguise because...

SANDERS: Makes you work.

YANG: If I would've went to like a Chinese-heavy high school here in America, I could've just kind of hermitted (ph) in that sense and never really fully assimilated. You know what I mean?

SANDERS: Yeah. Well, I love how you describe how you figured out the culture and the language. There was one big kind of TV textbook for you, which was BET, Black Entertainment Television.

YANG: Oh, yeah.

SANDERS: That's kind of like how you taught yourself English and American culture. Actually, we have some tape of the time where you, I guess, shut down Arsenio Hall's show.

YANG: Oh, I did.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

YANG: When I first came here - this is a true story. When I first came here, I barely spoke a word of English. And I learned how to speak English by watching a lot of television. Two months into it, I realized I was watching Telemundo.

(LAUGHTER)

YANG: I didn't really know. Like, what is (speaking Spanish)? And there's, like, 12 of them? What is that? So eventually I switched the channel. And you can still hear it in my voice today. I learned most of my English by watching BET "Rap City."

(CHEERING)

YANG: Yeah. Big Tig and "Tha Basement," "Freestyle Friday." There's nothing more American than Snoop Dogg, you know? And I didn't know any better. I just thought that's how everybody talked. So I went up to the lunch lady the next day. I'm like, ay, what it do, shorty? Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

SANDERS: Talk about all of that because I find it so fascinating.

YANG: I think watching TV is one of the most important cultural lessons anyone can learn because it's not - the TV programming tells you what Americans like. And also the commercials tells you what they're really buying into, right? Like even the tone of the commercials is different. Here it's funnier whereas in Hong Kong, it's made more heartfelt, more family oriented - right? - instead of usually the dumb, bumbling husband and the wife yelling at him.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: Like here in America.

SANDERS: Or like, I'm a man, and I don't know how to change a diaper - whoa.

YANG: Yeah, exactly.

SANDERS: I hate those.

YANG: Yeah. So that really tells you about culture. And one of the most interesting channels I found when I was flipping through channels was BET. I'd never seen anything like that. It was, like, not just America. It's a very...

SANDERS: No. I've never seen anything like BET either. It is one of a kind.

YANG: It's a very specific part of America. And it was so intriguing to me as a 13-year-old boy. First of all, you've got "Rap City."

SANDERS: Oh, yeah.

YANG: Right? With Big Tig and "Tha Basement."

SANDERS: Oh, yeah.

YANG: And that was amazing. I'd never heard hip-hop music.

SANDERS: See, I was on BET before that, even, when they were still doing "Video Soul."

YANG: Oh, my God.

SANDERS: You remember "Video Soul?"

YANG: No, that was a little before my time.

SANDERS: You probably were too young for that. This was, like, when they were doing, like, straight-up, just straight ahead R&B. And then they moved more into rap with "Rap City" and Tigger.

YANG: "106 & Park."

SANDERS: "106 & Park" was the jam. Anyways, you watched BET. You're watching rap videos.

YANG: Yeah.

SANDERS: Rap teaches you English, basically.

YANG: Rap teaches me English because to me - I could not understand a word of that. Like in school in conversation or even when I'm watching a Nickelodeon cartoon, I can understand some of it. But the way rappers are speaking, I'm like, if I can understand this - this is like calculus to me.

SANDERS: Oh.

YANG: If I could figure this out, I can understand algebra. I can understand...

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: ...Everything else. So...

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: ...To me, like, BET was like calculus. I needed to figure it out, and I needed to understand what they were talking about culturally to understand America - and not just "Rap City." "Comic View" was another show.

SANDERS: Oh, this is - so for those who don't know, it was BET's probably - their version of "Def Comedy Jam."

YANG: Absolutely.

SANDERS: Stand-up comics are...

YANG: Just five-minute...

SANDERS: Who was your favorite one?

YANG: Oh, I love all of hosts - J. Anthony Brown, Bruce Bruce...

SANDERS: Bruce Bruce was amazing.

YANG: ...Rickey Smiley.

SANDERS: See I was all - Rickey Smiley. Oh, my God. He's the best.

YANG: Yeah.

SANDERS: His radio stuff is amazing, too. His radio show.

YANG: Yeah, now he's killing it.

SANDERS: I used to love Sommore.

YANG: Yes.

SANDERS: She was so good.

YANG: Yes.

SANDERS: So between black comedy and black rap and hip-hop, you acculturate yourself to America.

YANG: Yeah.

SANDERS: Were people at your schools loving you giving off that black swag?

YANG: I think they just thought I was weird.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: You know, but it's better to be, like, the weird kid than the foreign kid to some - like, to be, like...

SANDERS: Explain.

YANG: ...The weird hip-hop kid...

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: ...Than the weird foreign kid because I went so hard in that hip-hop direction to try to cover up that - the fact that I'm an immigrant, and I have kind of like a Chinese accent. I covered it up with a hip-hop accent in a way. So now they just looked at me like, oh, OK. Yeah. Good for him. He just loves, you know, BET...

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: ...Instead of like, he's a weird foreign kid.

SANDERS: All right. Time for a quick break. When we come back, Jimmy struggles through college and finds stand-up comedy. BRB.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

SANDERS: So you love rap so much. You love hip-hop so much. You love BET so much. You end up talking about in the book how you and the friends you made in high school - Beverly Hills High School...

YANG: Yeah. My dad used a fake address.

SANDERS: (Laughter) You got to do what you got to do. You got to hustle.

YANG: He's the man. Yeah.

SANDERS: But at Beverly Hills High School, you and some other immigrant friends form a rap group. And then you become like a hip-hop rap producer - like you make beats.

YANG: Yeah. That was...

SANDERS: You're a producer.

YANG: ...My first, I guess, creative outlet. I've always loved, like, just building stuff, like, making stuff. And this was the first thing that I found really, really rewarding was making something out of nothing.

SANDERS: Had you had musical experience?

YANG: I played the violin, of course...

SANDERS: You say, of course.

YANG: ...Since I was, like, 5. You know, I was in the school orchestra and everything.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: So I kind of know some music. But really when it comes to making a beat, especially when I was doing it, when I had FruityLoops...

SANDERS: Yeah, I remember FruityLoops.

YANG: ...Like, you know, those beat-making programs...

SANDERS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

YANG: ...It was just messing on a computer.

SANDERS: How do I find your beats online? Are they online?

YANG: They used to be. I don't think they are anymore.

SANDERS: They're all the way gone. What would I search for?

YANG: I'll post something. You can't - you really can't search for anything. I'll post some on my website.

SANDERS: You should send us something, and then we can wrap the interview with, like, one of your beats.

YANG: Yes, yes.

SANDERS: Seriously.

YANG: I have some pretty cool beats. I got pretty good at it. I was selling beats at some point.

SANDERS: You know, everyone says that.

YANG: No...

SANDERS: My beats are great.

YANG: ...I got to a point where I got my first paycheck.

SANDERS: From what?

YANG: You read it in the book.

SANDERS: I sure did, but I want you to say it.

YANG: It was a - from a porno website...

SANDERS: A porno website...

YANG: ...As background music.

SANDERS: ...Bought one of your rap beats when you were a high school student at Beverly Hills High.

YANG: Oh, boy.

SANDERS: Only in America.

YANG: I thought I made it. I made, like...

SANDERS: How much did they pay?

YANG: ...Three hundred bucks, man. You know, that was big.

SANDERS: (Laughter) So that's high school. High school finishes, and then your dad is like, bro, you've got to go to college.

YANG: Oh, that's - I don't have a choice.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: There's never a conversation of, like, you need to go to college. It's just, oh, what's after high school? Yeah, college.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: That's it.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: Like, which college are you going to go to? That's the conversation. So I was - I didn't know any better. I didn't get into UCLA or USC.

SANDERS: Their loss.

YANG: Yeah, their loss. And then I end up just - got a - I got accepted to UCSD. I'm like, that's basically UCLA, but in the beautiful beach town of San Diego.

SANDERS: (Laughter) Except actually totally different.

YANG: Yeah. I didn't even go visit. I'm like, this is close enough. I'll just go there.

SANDERS: Wow.

YANG: And it turned out to be the worst college experience for the five - next five years.

SANDERS: What about our listeners that are - that are alumni of UCSD and loved their time there?

YANG: I just - look, maybe it's not UCSD. I shouldn't be that biased. I just hated school.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: I should have dropped out. If I wasn't Asian, I would've dropped out.

SANDERS: But then you end up majoring in what? Econ?

YANG: Econ because...

SANDERS: Because...

YANG: ...That's the easiest major that still pleases your Asian parents. So I'm like, OK, I'll just get this econ degree done and I'll say I've done it and I'll figure my life out.

SANDERS: And you like just did it. What was it, like, a 2.7 GPA?

YANG: 2.7 GPA - I never went to class. I was depressed.

SANDERS: And still got a 2.7.

YANG: I was smoking weed. And I would just show up at the final - I would cram like a week before. I never learned anything because you just cram, you forget about it.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And I'd cram and then I'd go take the test. I'd get a C and then I'd pass the class.

SANDERS: Even through that, though, your dad gets you an internship doing what? Like, some financial advising stuff.

YANG: Yeah, Smith Barney - like, a really nice...

SANDERS: That was for real.

YANG: ...High-end - yeah - firm. It's like every Asian parent's dream. Like, people - other kids are, like, hoping they would get this internship. But a month in, I just hated the Smith Barney job. Like, I just - I was, like - I was having panic attacks. I'm like I'm going to be sitting behind this desk for the next 40 years...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...Managing other people's mutual fund that I don't care about. I can't do this.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: Like, that was a panic attack. That was scarier to me than trying to pursue the arts going into the unknown.

SANDERS: Really?

YANG: Because getting stuck - seeing my life rotting away for sure is scarier than the unknown. So for me, it wasn't ever a choice.

SANDERS: So then how'd you go from there to comedy to acting?

YANG: I just had to try different things to get out of this job.

SANDERS: What - so what was the first thing you did after the job?

YANG: It wasn't comedy. Comedy was never like - I mean, I watched comedy and I loved it but it wasn't like, oh, I watched "Eddie Murphy Raw" with my brother when I was a kid, I needed to be a stand-up. It was never that. It was just - I needed to find something to do with my life. I needed to find new, creative friends.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And I was pretty good at talking to people. I was kind of always the funny kid in the group, but everybody says that, right?

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: You know, how many people actually make it as a stand-up?

SANDERS: Everybody says that they're funny and everybody says that their beats are good.

(LAUGHTER)

YANG: Look, the main...

SANDERS: I got to hear a beat.

YANG: I - I'll - I'll send you some. The main - the main prerequisite to being a stand-up is not talent. It's not being funny. It's desperation. You needed to be that desperate to go on the stage to embarrass yourself, right?

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: I always say Googling local open mics on your computer is one step away from Googling what's the best way to kill myself.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: It's that close. Every stand-up I've ever met, the guy on the stand will come - something happened in their life. They quit being a lawyer and they got a divorce or they got their third DUI, they just got out of jail, and now they want to try stand-up.

SANDERS: So you join those ranks.

YANG: Yeah, I join those ranks.

SANDERS: You start doing open mics. And - and for a while you are actually paying money to be on stage yourself.

YANG: At the Ha Ha Comedy Club, you get to go on stage anytime you want at the open mic every day, which is great, but you have to pay $5 to - in exchange for $5 of stage time.

SANDERS: Five minutes of stage time.

YANG: Oh, yeah, yeah - $5 of stage time. That should be my next book, "Five Dollars of Stage Time."

SANDERS: "Five Dollars of Stage Time." So how was that?

YANG: I went to this open mic and I just did it and it was fun. It was liberating in a way. But my favorite part was - literally, my first set was talking about masturbation, just like every other new comic - right? - because you don't know what - you're just - you're just trying to survive. You're just trying to be funny.

SANDERS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

YANG: But then people would give me taglines. Other comics would give me, like - yo, you should say this, you should say that. And I really found this, like, group of misfits. Everybody was so weird in their own way. And this is like the only world where the weirder you are, the better off you are.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So it's, like, the first time I felt like I really fit in.

SANDERS: Well - and this is the interesting thing that I loved that you talked about at length in the book. You really draw this distinct comparison between acting and stand-up.

YANG: Oh, yeah.

SANDERS: Stand-up was very egalitarian and diverse and for everybody, as long as you're funny. And acting, you said, quote, is, like, "the only profession where you can actually physically discriminate."

YANG: Oh, yeah.

SANDERS: It's like they're night and day.

YANG: You know, when I auditioned for "Crazy Rich Asians" I called my manager. I'm like, this is, like, a very important movie for us.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: I know I'm usually the quirky, you know, sidekick guy or whatever, but let me just go try to read for the lead role. I don't care.

SANDERS: Oh, look at you.

YANG: Like, this is...

SANDERS: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

YANG: ...Really special for us and I'm very confident my acting ability. I'm like, let me audition for the lead role.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And my manager's just like, look; I don't know how to tell you this, but they're looking for a good-looking guy for the lead role (laughter).

SANDERS: He said that?

YANG: Yes. And I totally understood what he meant.

SANDERS: No, you should have fired your manager.

YANG: No. Like, I get it. Like, I'm a fairly decent-looking guy in real life. But my type is not the good-looking, chiseled man. You feel me? Like, my agent used to always tell me, you have a good look. And I was, like, OK. Cool. I have a good look. But then I realized having a good look is different than being good-looking.

SANDERS: Oh.

YANG: Like, Ryan Gosling is good-looking. Me and Luis Guzman...

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: ...Have a good look. You know, like, I look like the computer person...

SANDERS: OK (laughter).

YANG: ...Or like the college kid. Luis Guzman look like, you know, papi. He looks like...

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: ...The drug dealer...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...Sometimes in his movies, right?

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So we have a good look.

SANDERS: A good look.

YANG: We rely on...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...A good look...

SANDERS: Yes.

YANG: ...Whereas other people are just good-looking.

SANDERS: Got you. Yeah. I want to talk more about the acting world...

YANG: Yes.

SANDERS: ...And how you got there.

YANG: Yeah.

SANDERS: Briefly walk through from you just paying $5 to get five minutes of stage time to do comedy to, like, landing a role on an HBO show. Like, you kind of struggled in the wilderness for a while. You were doing this comedy stuff. You end up in San Diego again.

YANG: Yeah.

SANDERS: And then you end up - by virtue of liking one of your fellow comics, you end up deejaying at a strip club.

YANG: Uh-huh (ph). That's true.

SANDERS: That is - and you wanted to do that.

YANG: I think everybody that grew up watching...

SANDERS: No, no, no, that's...

YANG: ...Too much Ludacris music videos want to go work at a - deejay at a strip - that seems so glamorous, like, in our pop culture, in a way.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: Or especially for a stupid, 22-year-old kid.

SANDERS: But the...

YANG: But it's not.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: It's not, especially the strip club I worked at. It was really seedy. It was ran by gangsters. I had to work there on Christmas. Like, it was bad. And, you know, it was a really just dark vibe. I was delivering the cashbox to the owner's house every night. I could've gotten shot. And, yeah, it was just a bad environment. And that was the reason why I had to really leave San Diego.

SANDERS: Well, because one of your comedy friends was like, you've got to get the hell out of there.

YANG: Yeah. Like, my mentor Sean Kelly, he was, like, dude, you got to get out. Like, this is not you. You're a good kid, you know?

SANDERS: Uh-huh.

YANG: Go out there. Go back to LA...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...And go pursue that. And I'm, like, yo, you're right.

SANDERS: And you did.

YANG: And I quit.

SANDERS: You just decided that you wanted to try comedy again or do acting or what?

YANG: I've been doing comedy.

SANDERS: Yes.

YANG: I got my chops working at the Comedy Palace at the door and, like, get some stage time in San Diego now. So I'm - I have a good 15 minutes at this point...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...You know?

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: But I'm like, how am I going to make money? All my strip club savings I'm putting into rent. I'm renting this guy's...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...Living room from Craigslist...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...Three hundred bucks a month. So I'm like, OK. I need to do some commercials. So how do you do that? I don't know. How do you become an actor?

SANDERS: (Laughter) I have no idea.

YANG: I don't know.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So I asked all my comedian friends who has just been on one commercial or been an extra in...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...The back of a movie.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...And they were telling me all the tips. They're like, go sign up on all the dot-coms - on LA Casting, Actors Access, whatever...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...All the casting websites. Put your headshot up there.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: Put your stand-up reel up there.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: You know, so I did that. And then I got a couple interviews from really small agencies, right?

SANDERS: Uh-huh.

YANG: My first agent's interview, I was, like, oh, my God. I'm going to make it.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: You know? That to me was like CAA calling me.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: And then I went there. The agency was in an apartment rental office.

SANDERS: Runaway.

YANG: Exactly. But I was so desperate, I was still trying to impress them. They had me read this Staples commercial.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: And I was so bad they're, like, thank you and never talked to me again.

SANDERS: Never talked to you again.

YANG: I was rejected by apartment rental office acting agent.

SANDERS: (Laughter) That's rough. That's LA, though.

YANG: Oh, my God.

SANDERS: I mean, the stories of rejection in this town are enough to make you cry.

YANG: Exactly. And everybody has been to Central Casting their first day off that Greyhound bus, you know?

SANDERS: The Greyhound bus - man.

YANG: And it was just sad. I was just - oh, my God. I'm, like, OK. I guess I'll try to grind it out doing stand-up, and maybe I should just give up at some point...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...Go back to get a finance job.

SANDERS: But then there was one agent.

YANG: There was one agent - very small agency in Manhattan Beach.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: And she called me, like, because she saw my - she's the one that said, I think you've got a good look.

SANDERS: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

YANG: And I'm, like, OK. Whatever. I don't even know what that means.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: I went and met up with her. And she was very honest. She was, like, look; I don't know if I can get you work, but I think you've got a good look. I'll submit some of your headshots.

SANDERS: Uh-huh.

YANG: And if it don't work out, you don't get called for the audition, so we can go our separate ways.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: And at that point, once again, I've got nothing to lose.

SANDERS: Yeah. Yeah.

YANG: I'm, like, sure.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: Please sign me.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And then she starts sending me out. Like, she really believed me. I guess I did have a good look, you know? And I auditioned for, like, "Modern Family" - just, like, two-line parts - and, like, commercials that I really wanted to audition for. But money was running out, and I wasn't booking any of these jobs. And auditioning is, like, a totally different sport than acting.

SANDERS: Oh, I'm sure.

YANG: And now I have to put in whatever money I have left or whatever money I earn from doing stand-up into acting classes...

SANDERS: Huh.

YANG: ...To just kind of know what I'm doing.

SANDERS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

YANG: Maybe naturally, I'm a pretty good actor...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...But it's still...

SANDERS: It's a science in its...

YANG: Yeah, there's a science to it, especially...

SANDERS: And there's...

YANG: ...Audition process.

SANDERS: Well, there's a language that you did not know. What was the thing that they say - slate your name or...

YANG: Slate your name - what the hell is slate?

SANDERS: Why don't they just say, say your name? Who are you?

YANG: Just say, say your name.

SANDERS: What does the slate even mean?

YANG: They say - I don't know. I still don't know.

SANDERS: They say, slate your name, and you don't know what that means.

YANG: Yeah. Basically, that just means, I'm Jimmy O. Yang, and I'm 5'6".

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: You know?

SANDERS: So you do the audition live, and then you end up auditioning for an HBO pilot which at first was called - what? It wasn't called "Silicon Valley" first.

YANG: It was called "DeepTech."

SANDERS: "DeepTech."

YANG: I don't know if this is, like, top secret, but I wrote in my book. The show was called "DeepTech" before it was ever called "Silicon Valley."

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And...

SANDERS: And you do the audition.

YANG: I do the audition.

SANDERS: You think nothing of it. It happens. And then you find out once you get the show that the guy that created the show, Mike Judge, was your commencement speaker.

YANG: That's my guy.

SANDERS: ...At UCSD.

YANG: Yep.

SANDERS: And he was one of the big inspirations for you that made you want to not do, like, finance stuff.

YANG: Absolutely.

SANDERS: That's crazy, right? Tell us the whole story.

YANG: Mike Judge, the guy that created "Beavis and Butt-Head," "King Of The Hill," of course "Silicon Valley"...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...He was my commencement speaker at UCSD. And he also went to UCSD.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And he kind of shared the same experience I did. He didn't really enjoy college too much. He was a physics major. The dude's really smart. He ended up programming, like, computer chips on fighter jets or something like that. But he just hated that whole culture, the corporate culture. And that's why he wrote "Office Space," right?

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And then he was like, I just need to find a passion. So I quit - he quit this job. And then he came back around. When he found animation, he knew he found that thing that ticks. And he knew he found his passion. And he just grinded it out, you know, in a basement or in his garage, making "Beavis and Butt-Head," making his first animatic.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And as a lost college student at that moment, not knowing what I wanted to do - all I knew was I didn't want to do economics, the thing that I majored in. And this is permission that my parents never gave me. And I'm like - just seeing a living example of a man that I actually know his name from Hollywood, TV shows and movies - making it. And in the same exact shoe I was - went to the same exact college. It doesn't seem like a far-fetched inspirational story.

SANDERS: You can do it.

YANG: It seems like this could be me.

SANDERS: Yeah. Well, you know, you have this line in the book and in that story. You say, part of what Mike Judge was kind of saying was, quote, "pursue what you love, not what you should."

YANG: Absolutely. And that's still what I believe in because to me it's so scary - maybe it's fear that led me to it because I'm sure there's a lot of people that settle into a job that they should be doing - right? - that their parents tell them...

SANDERS: Which is no shame on that.

YANG: No shame on that. And some people are cool with that. And they're very happy doing it. I wish I was that guy, right? You know, I'll probably have two kids and be very happy, probably - maybe happier than I am now. But for me, it was the fear - like, I was so scared working behind a desk and being stuck behind a desk - that I really cannot do it anymore. And it's, you know, that speech that really spoke to me. And boom, five years later, I auditioned for "Silicon Valley."

SANDERS: And then it happens.

YANG: And then it happens. It didn't happen right away. You know, I - the part was a guest star part with three lines or something.

SANDERS: Yeah. I eat the fish.

YANG: And they called me - yeah. And then they called me back. That was the second episode, was the I eat the fish. The third episode was just me saying no and no, like, three times to T.J. Those three episodes I was in the first season, I got paid 900 bucks per episode at SAG minimum scale.

SANDERS: So for the whole first season of HBO's "Silicon Valley," you got - what? - $2,700.

YANG: Twenty-seven hundred dollars. And I used that as a down payment on a 2006 Prius so I can drive Uber.

SANDERS: Stop.

YANG: I was driving Uber between Season 1 and 2 of "Silicon Valley."

SANDERS: Do you still have the Prius?

YANG: Oh, no. I gave it to my brother.

SANDERS: OK, look at you - good sibling.

YANG: Yeah, so he could drive Uber.

SANDERS: What are you driving now?

YANG: I have a Lexus, a lease.

SANDERS: Oh, OK. OK, I see you.

YANG: No, it's an entry-level - IS 200. It's a very - a four-cylinder car. You know, it's just a write-off. That's why - that's why I have it.

SANDERS: One more break here. When we come back, more about "Silicon Valley" and how Jimmy deals with success. All right, BRB.

(SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' "FLICKER")

SANDERS: For our listeners who are not watching "Silicon Valley," describe your character for them.

YANG: So Jian-Yang, the character that I play, is a geek, is a computer programmer, just like everybody else on the show. And he's an immigrant, also. But in a way, he's kind of brave. And I kind of like him because he's - one article wrote this term. It said he's kind of like an anti-assimilation character. Because for me, for so long in my life being an immigrant, I tried to - try as hard as I could to be American.

Jian-Yang doesn't care. He thinks he's cool the way he is. And he's kind of - as the seasons go on becomes kind of evil. And he becomes kind of like a pain in the butt for a lot of people. So it's very interesting to play this person who you think is a docile, stereotypical immigrant, but he actually has a pretty sharp comeback to a lot of things and a dark side to him.

SANDERS: There was something you said about playing that role that really stuck out to me. Like, the kind of mantra for that character, was it I don't know anything?

YANG: Oh, yeah. So he has a...

SANDERS: Is that the right phrase?

YANG: Yes. I don't know. And I always say the mantra to myself in Mandarin. It's (speaking Mandarin) - right? - which means I don't know because first of all, I have to practice thinking in Mandarin a little more with this character because I want that accent to be authentic. I want it to sound like one of my uncles or like my mother, you know? And it's a very specific Mandarin accent. It's not just like a cliche, Cantonese, Bruce Lee accent, right? So I just want it to be a real person.

So every day I go to the Sony lot to shoot the show. I listen to 1300 AM, the Mandarin station, for, like, an hour. And then I try to just think in Mandarin. And I was thinking this mantra (speaking Mandarin) - I don't know, I don't know. And I think in that because that's the bane of his existence. First of all, it's the Mandarin. Second of all, it's I don't know - either he actually doesn't know what's going on like me back in the day when I didn't know what what's up meant, or he actually just doesn't care to know.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: You know?

SANDERS: And he's probably like - I mean, I'm sure that so much of the immigrant experience when there's a language barrier is just being frustrated that people don't understand you.

YANG: Exactly. And what's great about Jian-Yang it's like he kind of doesn't care that he's like, you know, frustrating other people. And a lot of the jokes - even like the I eat the fish scene with T.J.'s character, which became, like, my nemesis on the show...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...And we had a great dynamic. When he gets mad at me doing certain things, the joke's kind of on him being an impatient, you know, buffoonish, big American guy. And Jian-Yang kind of gets the upper hand throughout the season. And I kind of love it. Like, you don't have to fight fire with fire. He's just very chill, you know?

SANDERS: It is a subversive portrayal of an immigrant.

YANG: Yes.

SANDERS: It like - he knows what the hell's going on.

YANG: Oh, he knows what's going on.

SANDERS: And he's going to win.

YANG: Exactly. And especially this season, as you guys see, he - yeah. He gets kind of evil, too.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: Yeah.

SANDERS: Did you expect the show to be as big of a hit as it is? Did you...

YANG: Not...

SANDERS: ...How's it been?

YANG: Not at all when I first auditioned for it. You know, I knew Mike Judge is, like, serious business. But I don't - 'cause there are just so many TV programs out there. Like, so many shows - like, everybody's, like, almost a serious regular on the show now. But there are so many shows that people just don't watch. And I'm so fortunate that this is a show that gets attention from the award circuit. And people are actually watching. And this is my first show.

SANDERS: Yeah, dude.

YANG: How amazing is that? Like, I count my blessings every day.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And it's been incredible. And it happened really fast.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: But also it happened when I'm a little older. It didn't happen when I was, like, 20.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So I was a little - I, like, I know what's going on. I didn't let it get to my head. And my issue was not knowing what to do with myself. Like...

SANDERS: What do you mean?

YANG: ...Like, I still have pretty low self-esteem. I still try to go to Ross instead of, like, Nordstrom.

SANDERS: Ain't nothing wrong with Ross.

YANG: You know, like, because...

SANDERS: And listen; and a Nordstrom Rack will top a Nordstrom any GD day.

YANG: I have never bought anything at Nordstrom except for those pair of pants I bought for the Arsenio Hall Show. I thought I went all out.

SANDERS: I got lunch one day at the Nordstrom restaurant, but that's it.

YANG: Oh, yeah?

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: Yeah. There you go.

SANDERS: But Nordstrom Rack is the jam. Ross is the jam. You can - hold on to that.

YANG: Why would you go to Nordstrom when there's Nordstrom Rack?

SANDERS: Literally.

YANG: So like...

SANDERS: So you still are trying to convince yourself that you're worth it.

YANG: Yeah. And this year has been - gotten better, like, because I'm doing more - other stuff that's not - just because this is one thing that I started off as such a small part. I still in a sense think that I'm that guest-star side actor, you know, whenever I see myself there. But then, you know, I wrote the book.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: You know, I'm in a couple of movies. So that kind of - as an artist, my self-esteem is rising a little bit.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: You know, and it's starting to match, like, who I am, which is great.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And, you know, so...

SANDERS: I know that there are a lot of people listening who probably feel or have felt the same way - a little bit of imposter syndrome.

YANG: Exactly.

SANDERS: Do I deserve this? Give folks some advice on getting through that.

YANG: Well, first of all, it's good to have imposter syndrome.

SANDERS: Oh, OK.

YANG: It's fine. It keeps you humble.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: And it keeps you that wonderment - that awe that we talk about.

SANDERS: Yeah, yeah.

YANG: Like earlier, when I first came to America - like every time I go to, like, a Emmys after-party...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...I see Bryan Cranston there, like, whoever, like, Jon Snow, Kit Harrington.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: I'm still fanboying on the inside. And that feels good.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: That feels great.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: You don't want that to go away.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: You know, and the best feeling was, like - for example, Ken Jeong. I've been a fan of Ken Jeong.

SANDERS: Oh, yeah.

YANG: And I wanted to visit his show "Dr. Ken," which is now unfortunately canceled. And he fanboyed over me more than I fanboyed over him. I was, like, freaking out inside. And then he was like, Tran. He grabbed his wife Tran. He was like, Tran, come on. Come over. It's Jimmy. We've got to take a picture with Jimmy. And that is the coolest feeling ever. You don't ever want that to go away.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: You know, so it's kind of good to live in that imposter syndrome and to approach this as an outsider instead of, you know, saying, I'm Hollywood. I deserve this.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: I'm - like, you know, it's good to know that maybe artistically, maybe in your craft you're as good as some of these people, and that's why you're here. And be confident with your craft. But keep that sense of wonderment.

SANDERS: I like that. I'm sure that what must also help you kind of get to a place of satisfaction is, like, knowing that your dad is a bit more supportive of you now, so much so...

YANG: Slightly.

SANDERS: ...Yeah. You even - so supportive that you even got him in a movie.

YANG: Yeah.

SANDERS: Tell that story.

YANG: My dad started acting. I don't know if it's out of support.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: It's a little bit out of spite. He was like, oh, it's so easy. You can do it. I can probably do it.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: Because I'm sure, just like everyone else, deep down there's a part of him always wanted to be an actor.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: But, you know, just like how he taught me - he didn't think it was possible.

SANDERS: Well, also because, like, in Hong Kong, in China...

YANG: You can't just get up and be an actor.

SANDERS: It's different acting. There is no such thing as stand-up there really, right?

YANG: Exactly. There's...

SANDERS: So he couldn't conceptualize what you were doing for a while.

YANG: Right. He still calls stand-up a talk show.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: Because that's not really a thing back in the day in China.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So he was like, it's so easy. You can do it. I can do it. I'm like, OK. You know what? This is a perfect time for me to show you how hard acting is.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: How hard the audition process is.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: So I'm like - so I call my agent. I'm like, do you need an old Asian person on your roster?

SANDERS: Wait. That - wait. Stop right there. One, that is unbelievable to me. You just called an agent being like, give my dad some work.

YANG: Well, still that smaller agent, right?

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So I'm like, my dad has a good look.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: So the - you know, can you sign up...

SANDERS: Did you just say that your dad's not good-looking?

YANG: Hey. I didn't say that.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: I just said he had a good look, OK? So (laughter) I'm like, do you - maybe you can send him out on some commercials. Just so - to teach him a lesson.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So he can see how hard this is. And she was like, yeah. You know what? Actually, I could use an Asian dude on my roster - old Asian dude because there's only, like, two old Asian people in Hollywood, right?

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So my dad could have been, like, one of the pre-eminent old Asian dudes. And then the plan completely backfired because he started booking everything.

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: He booked his first four out of his six auditions, which is unheard of.

SANDERS: He ended up in a show that was popular back in China?

YANG: Yeah, he ended a show called "Big Daddy (ph)" that, like, is, like, one of the most popular shows in China.

SANDERS: Oh, my goodness.

YANG: When they shot it, we didn't think much of it because we were like, we've never heard of the show; whatever.

SANDERS: Yeah. Yeah.

YANG: And it's, like, a billion people watching it in China. My aunt called our house here in LA, and she was like, Richard, you're so good in the show. Your son must have taken after you. Did you teach him how to act?

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: I'm like, man, come on, man.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So he was like, oh, it is easy, huh? There's nothing special about what you did.

SANDERS: Yeah. So you and your dad were actually in a movie together.

YANG: "Patriots Day."

SANDERS: Which is about...

YANG: Which is about the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the tragedy and the heroes and the victims of it.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: Like, it's really a heavy movie, and it's my first dramatic role.

SANDERS: And you play a really pivotal role in the movie.

YANG: I play this guy Dun Meng, who is also a Chinese immigrant, and he kind of saved the day. He's the unsung hero of that marathon bombing because he got carjacked and kidnapped by the Tsarnaev terrorist brothers.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And he made a brave, heroic escape at gunpoint.

SANDERS: He just jump out of the car.

YANG: Ran out to a gas station and called the police.

SANDERS: That's - that is bravery.

YANG: And that's how they led the police to tracking down that car and tracking down the two terrorists.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And I was so proud to play that role.

SANDERS: I bet.

YANG: And the whole time Pete Berg, the director, and Mark Wahlberg, the star and the producer, was like, we got to get this right. This movie's not about us. It's about the heroes and the victims.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...And we got to get everything authentic and right.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So I get to hang out with Danny - Dun Meng - every day, I was in Boston.

SANDERS: The real-life Dun Meng, yeah.

YANG: Yeah And I was bugging him about what happened, and he was so nice, and he's one of the kindest people ever.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So I was just - want to get it right. And then there's a scene with him Skyping with his dad back home in China - or his parents. And the dad they had casted had a Cantonese accent when he spoke Mandarin. Now...

SANDERS: Which is a no-no.

YANG: Right. Like, to American audience or to most audiences, they wouldn't know what's going on. But to me, if I want to keep it authentic, I want to make it my job to keep it authentic...

SANDERS: Got to keep it 100.

YANG: ...And what I know, right?

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So I went up to Pete. I'm like, this guy speaks, you know, Mandarin in a Cantonese accent. It's just not right.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And the mom speaks in a different, you know, accent because she speaks proper Mandarin. And then he was like, OK, good, let's get you a new dad; I'm glad you said something. And I'm like, Pete, I was sitting...

SANDERS: That poor guy (laughter).

YANG: Yeah, whatever. So then I sat in at the casting sessions. I offered Pete to sit in. I'm like, I'll sit in your casting sessions.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And I'll make sure, you know, the person's authentic.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: And then I had this lightbulb moment. I'm like, you know what? Why don't you guys just cast my dad? He's an actor.

SANDERS: Yeah. Yeah.

YANG: He's a real actor.

SANDERS: He's union. Yeah.

YANG: And he speaks Mandarin very authentically. And then Pete was like, done, get him out here. And I got my dad his first union SAG job.

SANDERS: That is some full circle. So you go from having a father that is mad that you don't become, like, a doctor, an engineer or a finance guy, mad you're doing stand-up, mad you're trying to act. And then he is in a movie with you.

YANG: Because I hooked him up.

SANDERS: You've got to hook it up.

YANG: Yeah.

SANDERS: That's amazing.

YANG: And that was one of the best experiences to kind of be behind the cameras when my dad is acting.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...And knowing that - like, you know, at that moment, I think he was pretty proud.

SANDERS: Oh, I'm sure he was.

YANG: And at the "Patriots Day" premiere...

SANDERS: Oh, I bet.

YANG: ...You know, I think he was proud. He's still telling everybody, like, yeah, yeah, yeah, my son's in "Patriots Day," but did you know I...

SANDERS: (Laughter).

YANG: ...I was in "Patriots Day" also? You know, so he's still kind of bragging. But, like, you know what? I'm happy.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: I'm happy that he's happy about it, you know?

SANDERS: Yeah. So OK, you're 30 years old. You are doing comedy on "Arsenio Hall." You're in major motion pictures. You're on a hit HBO show. You got your dad in the biz. I'm sure someone at your age who has accomplished this much could say, all right, I'm good; whatever else happens, I'm good.

YANG: Right.

SANDERS: But I'm guessing you have some other challenges lined up for yourself, some other goals to accomplish.

YANG: Absolutely. I think...

SANDERS: What is next for you? What else do you want to do?

YANG: I think this is the fun part, where people are finally paying attention to who I am...

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: ...And my projects that I want to do.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So I want to do more writing...

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: ...Screenwriting.

SANDERS: OK.

YANG: And I want to turn this book into, like, a TV show or a movie or something...

SANDERS: Ah.

YANG: ...And just kind of take it to the next level, man, and start creating what I want, right? 'Cause I think, at the end of the day, like, artists become who they are because, you know, we love creating stuff, you know? Even, like, building Legos felt great to me.

SANDERS: Yeah.

YANG: So, like, this is where it gets fun. It's not like, oh, I did my job; I can go to Hawaii and chill out now, you know? It's not.

SANDERS: Now you get to...

YANG: Like, this is where it gets exciting. This is the fun part.

SANDERS: OK. So that means you're going to make a rap album, too.

YANG: Yes. I'm making a rap song with Too $hort right now.

SANDERS: Rap some of your lyrics.

YANG: No, no, I didn't rap. I just made the beat.

SANDERS: Oh, my goodness. Is it on YouTube?

YANG: Not yet. It's going to come out soon.

SANDERS: OK. OK.

YANG: Yeah.

SANDERS: I'm ready for it.

YANG: It's Too $hort, Dumbfoundead, which is, like, one of the most legit Asian rappers, and Awkwafina, my homie.

SANDERS: Awkwafina.

YANG: Yeah, yeah. So it's going to be a really sick song.

SANDERS: I love it. I'm not going to ask you to accompany me right now to El Pollo Loco.

YANG: (Laughter).

SANDERS: ...But one day.

YANG: Yes. We should exchange info.

SANDERS: One day.

YANG: You are so great.

SANDERS: Thanks, man.

YANG: Yeah.

SANDERS: Well, I'm in LA. We - seriously, we'll go to El Pollo Loco.

YANG: Let's do it. Let's do it.

SANDERS: ...Any friggin' (ph) time.

YANG: Yeah.
