    "This playbook demonstrates how to enable tool calling with memory on Llama 3.1 70B Instruct model using LangGraph, Tavily. Model inference is completed by API via NVIDIA NIMs. We will first explore implementing each feature/component individually. We explore implementing only persistent memory on LangGraph, then creating a ReAct agent with only Tavily web search tool -- and then lastly how both concepts can be combined for a ReAct agent with conversational memory and web search capabilities.\n",
